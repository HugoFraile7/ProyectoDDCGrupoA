I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

I had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and I got the phone a day earlier. This phone has 4g.The battery: I tested this one. I got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in Low Mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from iCloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. The phone was a bit warm and working hard. They guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. Mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and I just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. Don’t fret. My previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. They say you lose 1% a month. Not mine because I did battery saving things. At home I would plug it in since I watch battery-sucking things like long YT videos. Often I keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-I have to put in my Lock Screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. When I charge it I practically turn off the light. Turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. Keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. I think using it in airplane mode helps. I keep location services off until an app needs it. If you put it on Never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. If you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. Limit your notifications on your Lock Screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. Look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. It depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

Please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was NOT there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover I installed personally after purchasing.The Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iPhone without breaking the bank. As a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.Performance and Quality:The iPhone XR performs impressively well. The A12 Bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. The 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. Despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.Value for Money:At this price point, the iPhone XR is a fantastic deal. You get all the features and capabilities of an iPhone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. For those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.Condition:However, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. While these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. For instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. This is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.Overall:Overall, the Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black (Unlocked) (Renewed) is a solid purchase. It delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. While it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iPhone. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase!

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.Life got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!

It looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. It’s very bright . memory capacity I went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left I believe . The battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, I diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. Everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. I bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . It also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . It responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . Anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase! I am not a big reviewer and nor do I type but this is worth to help others make the best decision I’ve made. Seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Great Value: For a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. The price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.Battery Health: The battery health was at 90% when I received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.Camera Quality: The camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. It’s perfect for everyday photography.Storage Capacity: With 256GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.Cons:Minor Scratches: There were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.Accessories: The phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original Apple accessories.Echo Issue: Occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.Overall: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly iPhone with ample storage and great performance, the iPhone 11 256GB Renewed is a solid choice. Just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

He's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. I'm so proud of him. I'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. There were no scratches or any damage to the phone. The battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. I think he does charge it at school though. So maybe the battery life is not the best. But it works great for him right now.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery.

Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone.

I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a ""EXCELLENT"" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery.

Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery. I’m happy I was able to recycle and save money. 10/10

Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.Sorry my review is not more in depth.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery. I’m happy I was able to recycle and save money. 10/10

No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100%Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good.I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.Sorry my review is not more in depth.

Even so, the phone upon arrival smelled weird firstly llike as if it had mold on it. Secondly the phonewas dirty near teh ringer and alot of cracks and crevices. I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a ""EXCELLENT"" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery. I’m happy I was able to recycle and save money. 10/10

No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100%Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good.I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.Sorry my review is not more in depth.

Even so, the phone upon arrival smelled weird firstly llike as if it had mold on it. Secondly the phonewas dirty near teh ringer and alot of cracks and crevices. I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a ""EXCELLENT"" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery. I’m happy I was able to recycle and save money. 10/10

No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100%Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good.I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.Sorry my review is not more in depth.

Even so, the phone upon arrival smelled weird firstly llike as if it had mold on it. Secondly the phonewas dirty near teh ringer and alot of cracks and crevices. I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a ""EXCELLENT"" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

The positive comments gave me assurance so I am not surprised with the good quality! Phone came 2 days early and 3/4 charged. My data was transferred easily. Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too. Battery health is 89% which I don’t think is too bad for being used. If needed, next time I will get premium quality, which I am sure to have better battery. I’m happy I was able to recycle and save money. 10/10

No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100%Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good.I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.Sorry my review is not more in depth.

Even so, the phone upon arrival smelled weird firstly llike as if it had mold on it. Secondly the phonewas dirty near teh ringer and alot of cracks and crevices. I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a ""EXCELLENT"" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

Light scuffing on the side/corners but nothing too noticeable. I use a case 24/7 so it means nothing to me. No scratches on the screen/back/lenes. The camera works perfectly and audio too.

Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.Sorry my review is not more in depth.

Even so, the phone upon arrival smelled weird firstly llike as if it had mold on it. Secondly the phonewas dirty near teh ringer and alot of cracks and crevices. I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a ""EXCELLENT"" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

 I broke the screen of my iPhone X and got some cracks on the back. Initially, I planned to repair it at the Apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). So, I decided to buy a renewed phone on Amazon. I was a bit worried about the purchase until I received the phone. When I unboxed it, I was really amazed. There were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. It seemed too good to be true. I checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. Some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, I had a chance to test it. I had back-to-back Teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. The phone performed very well. I had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. Everything worked perfectly. Additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.I highly recommend MOBILESUPPLY to anyone looking for a quality products. Their product exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star.

The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper.  It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon.Update :Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative. I am thankful. I pray I get my money back on time. As of right now id rate my experience an 8/10 !

I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery.Update (12/15/23): Ordered a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%.Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended.Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. Reducing overall rating to 4-stars.Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered.Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%.Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up.Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.Related Products:Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, US Version, 256GB, Midnight - Unlocked (Renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z4681LQ/Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHFGJXF

The transfer of all previous apps went seamlessly although I’m holding off on their Face ID.I enjoy seeing it automatically turn on when I reach for it, the durability and obviously the 3 lense standard is something that help me blend in with the normies.

The size of this phone is wayyyy bigger than my last one like a mini ipad or something maybe i’m over exaggerating lol. but as far a looks everything is good and peachy nothing is wrong with the phone the audio and cameras and everything works perfectly fine as if i went to the apple store. and so far it’s very durable not easy to break unless that is your full intentions on doing so . 30/10 WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND

The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper.  It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon.Update :Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative. I am thankful. I pray I get my money back on time. As of right now id rate my experience an 8/10 !

I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery.Update (12/15/23): Ordered a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%.Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended.Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. Reducing overall rating to 4-stars.Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered.Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%.Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up.Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.Related Products:Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, US Version, 256GB, Midnight - Unlocked (Renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z4681LQ/Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHFGJXF

The transfer of all previous apps went seamlessly although I’m holding off on their Face ID.I enjoy seeing it automatically turn on when I reach for it, the durability and obviously the 3 lense standard is something that help me blend in with the normies.

The size of this phone is wayyyy bigger than my last one like a mini ipad or something maybe i’m over exaggerating lol. but as far a looks everything is good and peachy nothing is wrong with the phone the audio and cameras and everything works perfectly fine as if i went to the apple store. and so far it’s very durable not easy to break unless that is your full intentions on doing so . 30/10 WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND

The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper.  It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon.Update :Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative. I am thankful. I pray I get my money back on time. As of right now id rate my experience an 8/10 !

I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery.Update (12/15/23): Ordered a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%.Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended.Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. Reducing overall rating to 4-stars.Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered.Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%.Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up.Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.Related Products:Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, US Version, 256GB, Midnight - Unlocked (Renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z4681LQ/Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHFGJXF

It is like a brand new phone. Not a scratch or a ding to it. It has been running optimally without and issues. I am grateful to have put trust in this company for a real iPhone product. The charge is excellent and the battery last without charge a full day and evening depending on what you’re doing. I would most definitely purchase from this company again if I need another iPhone.

The transfer of all previous apps went seamlessly although I’m holding off on their Face ID.I enjoy seeing it automatically turn on when I reach for it, the durability and obviously the 3 lense standard is something that help me blend in with the normies.

The size of this phone is wayyyy bigger than my last one like a mini ipad or something maybe i’m over exaggerating lol. but as far a looks everything is good and peachy nothing is wrong with the phone the audio and cameras and everything works perfectly fine as if i went to the apple store. and so far it’s very durable not easy to break unless that is your full intentions on doing so . 30/10 WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND

The phone was neatly packaged and wrapped, came with a charger and a sim card opener + the amazon renewed paper.  It had a couple scratches on the sides but they were very minor & not noticeable at all. The screen was very clear no cracks. My only issue is the screen when it’s turned on. It had this weird mild & subtle static & I can see a faint black grain when I am staring closely to the phone. Now I understand this phone is refurbished & renewed but I won’t lie the screen when I have the phone on really bugs me. I would be lying if I said I am totally satisfied with this phone. Not to mention the phone is kinda slow, it lags & the battery life I received when I when I went to the settings was at an 80 % .. *sighs* , trying to decide if I should thug it out & be delusional or just send the phone back even tho I fear the quality of phone I’d received next. I’ve contacted the seller .. I haven’t heard anything yet. I’ll update soon.Update :Ive decided to return the phone because I feel like I would be settling if I had to keep this phone. I will say though I am surprised the phone came in a very good condition. But truly there were internal hardware and software issues in terms of the static screen flickering/blinking that I just couldn't overlook. The seller has been responsive and cooperative. I am thankful. I pray I get my money back on time. As of right now id rate my experience an 8/10 !

I did a parallel test with another iPhone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. This is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery.Update (12/15/23): Ordered a 5th Amazon Premium Renewed phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%.Update (3/28/23): After lengthy discussions with Amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the Amazon Premium Renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the Amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended.Update (2/1/23): Ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine Apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. Reducing overall rating to 4-stars.Summary: Upgrading from an iPhone 7 plus, and decided I would go with the 11 Pro Max version. I was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what I considered.Observations: The high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%.Recommendation: After considering the factors, I decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. However, starting with the iPhone 8 (i think), Apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. To breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up.Carrier Lock: I decided I wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with Premium Renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.Conclusion: For the additional $100, I elected to go with the Renewed Premium. I rate both the Renewed and the Premium Renewed as 5-stars. Which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.Related Products:Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, US Version, 256GB, Midnight - Unlocked (Renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z4681LQ/Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 256GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsPrice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHFGJXF

Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it!

 I have a 14pro, I brought this phone for international use/ picture. Before I brought this I do some research how to check the phone, I was worry at the beginning because the seller Tech support don’t have much reviews. I decided give a try because I check all the seller for this phone they all have bad and good revives, and this phone compare other seller is more affordable. I brought this an excellent condition. When this arrive, no scratch, battery life is 100% I was stock, and I test the screen, sounds, camera, IMEI number…. etc  it will work!!! I am SOOOOO happy! This is a 5 years old phone, and this is not for primary use so I am not very worry about the battery, but it do get hot when you use.

There was a minor issue with delivery being delayed, but this wasn't the seller's fault.When I first received the phone, it looked brand new from a distance. On closer inspection, there were small scratches on the top, but they are barely noticeable and easily covered by a case. The screen had some hairline scratches, but they are not deep and you really have to look closely to see them. Not a big deal for me.The phone turned on without any issues. I did have some trouble setting up an account, but a call to Apple Support resolved this by updating the software. Again, not the seller’s fault.The battery health was at 83%, which is acceptable for a refurbished product. However, I have noticed that the phone drains battery a lot faster than I'd like. The software runs smoothly, and I haven't encountered any problems so far. Face ID works flawlessly.Overall, the phone is perfect and meets my expectations for a renewed product from Amazon.Tip: Before buying a refurbished product, make sure to do extensive research on the seller to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money.I’ll update this review in a few months with further feedback.

Will update if anything changes.Update: battery finally showing the real capacity at 89%. Took a few weeks to show after starting at 100%. Think its the original battery then but still very happy.

Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.

I decided give a try because I check all the seller for this phone they all have bad and good revives, and this phone compare other seller is more affordable. I brought this an excellent condition. When this arrive, no scratch, battery life is 100% I was stock, and I test the screen, sounds, camera, IMEI number…. etc  it will work!!! I am SOOOOO happy!

On closer inspection, there were small scratches on the top, but they are barely noticeable and easily covered by a case. The screen had some hairline scratches, but they are not deep and you really have to look closely to see them. Not a big deal for me.The phone turned on without any issues. I did have some trouble setting up an account, but a call to Apple Support resolved this by updating the software.

The software runs smoothly, and I haven't encountered any problems so far. Face ID works flawlessly.Overall, the phone is perfect and meets my expectations for a renewed product from Amazon.Tip: Before buying a refurbished product, make sure to do extensive research on the seller to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money.I’ll update this review in a few months with further feedback.

Will update if anything changes.Update: battery finally showing the real capacity at 89%. Took a few weeks to show after starting at 100%. Think its the original battery then but still very happy.

Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.

Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.

 I have a 14pro, I brought this phone for international use/ picture. Before I brought this I do some research how to check the phone, I was worry at the beginning because the seller Tech support don’t have much reviews. I decided give a try because I check all the seller for this phone they all have bad and good revives, and this phone compare other seller is more affordable. I brought this an excellent condition. When this arrive, no scratch, battery life is 100% I was stock, and I test the screen, sounds, camera, IMEI number…. etc  it will work!!! I am SOOOOO happy! This is a 5 years old phone, and this is not for primary use so I am not very worry about the battery, but it do get hot when you use.

Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down.

I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too.

 I have a 14pro, I brought this phone for international use/ picture. Before I brought this I do some research how to check the phone, I was worry at the beginning because the seller Tech support don’t have much reviews. I decided give a try because I check all the seller for this phone they all have bad and good revives, and this phone compare other seller is more affordable. I brought this an excellent condition. When this arrive, no scratch, battery life is 100% I was stock, and I test the screen, sounds, camera, IMEI number…. etc  it will work!!! I am SOOOOO happy! This is a 5 years old phone, and this is not for primary use so I am not very worry about the battery, but it do get hot when you use.

There was a minor issue with delivery being delayed, but this wasn't the seller's fault.When I first received the phone, it looked brand new from a distance. On closer inspection, there were small scratches on the top, but they are barely noticeable and easily covered by a case. The screen had some hairline scratches, but they are not deep and you really have to look closely to see them. Not a big deal for me.The phone turned on without any issues. I did have some trouble setting up an account, but a call to Apple Support resolved this by updating the software. Again, not the seller’s fault.The battery health was at 83%, which is acceptable for a refurbished product. However, I have noticed that the phone drains battery a lot faster than I'd like. The software runs smoothly, and I haven't encountered any problems so far. Face ID works flawlessly.Overall, the phone is perfect and meets my expectations for a renewed product from Amazon.Tip: Before buying a refurbished product, make sure to do extensive research on the seller to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money.I’ll update this review in a few months with further feedback.

Will update if anything changes.Update: battery finally showing the real capacity at 89%. Took a few weeks to show after starting at 100%. Think its the original battery then but still very happy.

 I have a 14pro, I brought this phone for international use/ picture. Before I brought this I do some research how to check the phone, I was worry at the beginning because the seller Tech support don’t have much reviews. I decided give a try because I check all the seller for this phone they all have bad and good revives, and this phone compare other seller is more affordable. I brought this an excellent condition. When this arrive, no scratch, battery life is 100% I was stock, and I test the screen, sounds, camera, IMEI number…. etc  it will work!!! I am SOOOOO happy! This is a 5 years old phone, and this is not for primary use so I am not very worry about the battery, but it do get hot when you use.

There was a minor issue with delivery being delayed, but this wasn't the seller's fault.When I first received the phone, it looked brand new from a distance. On closer inspection, there were small scratches on the top, but they are barely noticeable and easily covered by a case. The screen had some hairline scratches, but they are not deep and you really have to look closely to see them. Not a big deal for me.The phone turned on without any issues. I did have some trouble setting up an account, but a call to Apple Support resolved this by updating the software. Again, not the seller’s fault.The battery health was at 83%, which is acceptable for a refurbished product. However, I have noticed that the phone drains battery a lot faster than I'd like. The software runs smoothly, and I haven't encountered any problems so far. Face ID works flawlessly.Overall, the phone is perfect and meets my expectations for a renewed product from Amazon.Tip: Before buying a refurbished product, make sure to do extensive research on the seller to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money.I’ll update this review in a few months with further feedback.

Will update if anything changes.Update: battery finally showing the real capacity at 89%. Took a few weeks to show after starting at 100%. Think its the original battery then but still very happy.

Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.

I decided give a try because I check all the seller for this phone they all have bad and good revives, and this phone compare other seller is more affordable. I brought this an excellent condition. When this arrive, no scratch, battery life is 100% I was stock, and I test the screen, sounds, camera, IMEI number…. etc  it will work!!! I am SOOOOO happy!

On closer inspection, there were small scratches on the top, but they are barely noticeable and easily covered by a case. The screen had some hairline scratches, but they are not deep and you really have to look closely to see them. Not a big deal for me.The phone turned on without any issues. I did have some trouble setting up an account, but a call to Apple Support resolved this by updating the software.

The software runs smoothly, and I haven't encountered any problems so far. Face ID works flawlessly.Overall, the phone is perfect and meets my expectations for a renewed product from Amazon.Tip: Before buying a refurbished product, make sure to do extensive research on the seller to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money.I’ll update this review in a few months with further feedback.

Will update if anything changes.Update: battery finally showing the real capacity at 89%. Took a few weeks to show after starting at 100%. Think its the original battery then but still very happy.

Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.

Face ID works flawlessly.Overall, the phone is perfect and meets my expectations for a renewed product from Amazon.Tip: Before buying a refurbished product, make sure to do extensive research on the seller to ensure you’re getting the best value for your money.I’ll update this review in a few months with further feedback.

Glass protector came already installed. Although the maximum battery capacity shows 100%, the important battery message states that battery health is significantly degraded which could indicate that an aftermarket battery is installed. Battery life of the 12 mini is on par with the iPhone SE (3rd Gen) it replaced. I truly like the size of the 12 mini and it fits my lifestyle better compared to the SE. Face ID is awesome. Main reason I bought this phone is because I have a 160gb music library so now I can have all my music on 1 device which connects to any of the 3 vehicles I drive and wherever I go. Transfer from my SE to the 12 mini was a breeze. I can highly recommend the “renewed” program to anyone looking for a solid deal on phones that should last as long as Apple provides support.

Cell surfers has a great return policy if nessciary but so far so good. I am a very skeptical person and buying a refurbished phone online was always a little nerve racking for me but this phone has exceeded all my expectations so far. I trust cell surfers and you should to it was fast free shipping and they provided me with a return shipping label if I needed to send it back for any reason. Ships from the USA so I received it in 2 days. I have recommended this phone and company to everyone recently and am very happy with my purchase thus far. Will update if anything changes. If you are skeptical like me take the leap its worth it and if I doesn’t turn out like you expected they have the same return policy as Amazon so you can trust them. Great purchase!

Glass protector came already installed. Although the maximum battery capacity shows 100%, the important battery message states that battery health is significantly degraded which could indicate that an aftermarket battery is installed. Battery life of the 12 mini is on par with the iPhone SE (3rd Gen) it replaced. I truly like the size of the 12 mini and it fits my lifestyle better compared to the SE. Face ID is awesome. Main reason I bought this phone is because I have a 160gb music library so now I can have all my music on 1 device which connects to any of the 3 vehicles I drive and wherever I go. Transfer from my SE to the 12 mini was a breeze. I can highly recommend the “renewed” program to anyone looking for a solid deal on phones that should last as long as Apple provides support.

But I was pleasantly surprised. The battery capacity was 100% came with a screen protector fully charged when I received it and in great condition. Cell surfers has a great return policy if nessciary but so far so good. I am a very skeptical person and buying a refurbished phone online was always a little nerve racking for me but this phone has exceeded all my expectations so far. I trust cell surfers and you should to it was fast free shipping and they provided me with a return shipping label if I needed to send it back for any reason. Ships from the USA so I received it in 2 days. I have recommended this phone and company to everyone recently and am very happy with my purchase thus far. Will update if anything changes. If you are skeptical like me take the leap its worth it and if I doesn’t turn out like you expected they have the same return policy as Amazon so you can trust them. Great purchase!

The third one…it frequently won’t make or receive calls, has static, poor battery life, & also won’t set up facial recognition (though it doesn’t say to take it to Apple Store).

I like that it handles 5G networks and runs on the latest operating system (17).  This ""reconditioned"" or ""refurbished"" (EXCELLENT) phone truly looked brand-new.I've been using it for 3 days now, and it takes some getting used to, to navigate around the screens, finding your websites, tools, apps, etc. And CLOSING THEM is different, too. There's no more ""home"" button on the bottom center like my old phone.As for battery life, it seems to charge more quickly than my iPhone 7 did, but it still uses up the battery just as fast.  Today I started with 100% power at 7 am and didn't make a single call, but did a few texts (with a couple of attached photos) and did browse a few websites.  By 10 a.m. my battery was down to 80 percent.  Of course the phone came with one 120V wall charger and a cord, and all my other iPhone and iPad charging cables work with this one too.

I like that it handles 5G networks and runs on the latest operating system (17).  This ""reconditioned"" or ""refurbished"" (EXCELLENT) phone truly looked brand-new.I've been using it for 3 days now, and it takes some getting used to, to navigate around the screens, finding your websites, tools, apps, etc. And CLOSING THEM is different, too. There's no more ""home"" button on the bottom center like my old phone.As for battery life, it seems to charge more quickly than my iPhone 7 did, but it still uses up the battery just as fast.  Today I started with 100% power at 7 am and didn't make a single call, but did a few texts (with a couple of attached photos) and did browse a few websites.  By 10 a.m. my battery was down to 80 percent.  Of course the phone came with one 120V wall charger and a cord, and all my other iPhone and iPad charging cables work with this one too.

I ordered 2 for my kids.  Both phones were practically same condition.Cosmetic - One phone had a very tiny stress fracture on the screen that measured approx 1"" across.  It was only noticeable at direct light and 6"" away.  After laying a screen protector, it is not noticeable.  Both iphones had 1-2 tiny knicks on the screen.  Again, both are only noticeable up front and after laying a screen protector, it is barely noticeable.  The casings on both were near flawless.  I can tell the previous owners used screen protectors and cases with longevity in mind.  I grade both phones a 95% on appearance and like new cosmetically.Battery - One phone had 85% and other had 86%.  A bit on the lower end but its all a gamble going the refurbished route.  Not bad enough for me to deal with doing an exchange and take a chance I may get a worse condition phone.  I suspect its the original batteries in these 2 units.Function - speaker is loud, face ID works, touchscreen is good, sidebar buttons all work, rear and front cameras are clear, everything works as it should.  Doesn't seem to have aftermarket parts used on these phones as there is no pop up notification indicating so.  I suspect everything on these 2 phones were original.I will update this review after few weeks of use.  I am more curious on battery life so we'll see...8/18/2024 update:  kiddos reported the phone battery holds its charge fine. 1 full charge lasts them the whole day. They're using a fast charger purchased off Amazon and so far so good!

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…

I ordered 2 for my kids.  Both phones were practically same condition.Cosmetic - One phone had a very tiny stress fracture on the screen that measured approx 1"" across.  It was only noticeable at direct light and 6"" away.  After laying a screen protector, it is not noticeable.  Both iphones had 1-2 tiny knicks on the screen.  Again, both are only noticeable up front and after laying a screen protector, it is barely noticeable.  The casings on both were near flawless.  I can tell the previous owners used screen protectors and cases with longevity in mind.  I grade both phones a 95% on appearance and like new cosmetically.Battery - One phone had 85% and other had 86%.  A bit on the lower end but its all a gamble going the refurbished route.  Not bad enough for me to deal with doing an exchange and take a chance I may get a worse condition phone.  I suspect its the original batteries in these 2 units.Function - speaker is loud, face ID works, touchscreen is good, sidebar buttons all work, rear and front cameras are clear, everything works as it should.  Doesn't seem to have aftermarket parts used on these phones as there is no pop up notification indicating so.  I suspect everything on these 2 phones were original.I will update this review after few weeks of use.  I am more curious on battery life so we'll see...8/18/2024 update:  kiddos reported the phone battery holds its charge fine. 1 full charge lasts them the whole day. They're using a fast charger purchased off Amazon and so far so good!

For a refurbished phone, it looks brand new.  I was so glad to able to get an updated smartphone for just under $400 with plenty of space  (256MB).  Although it reads five stars, I reluctantly give it 4.85.  Only reason is because the battery health is at 86%. Yes I know that's still good, but would have been nice if it was above 90%, but hey you can't get everything when you buy second hand (LOL).  Overall, I'm very happy with it!!

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…

For a refurbished phone, it looks brand new.  I was so glad to able to get an updated smartphone for just under $400 with plenty of space  (256MB).  Although it reads five stars, I reluctantly give it 4.85.  Only reason is because the battery health is at 86%. Yes I know that's still good, but would have been nice if it was above 90%, but hey you can't get everything when you buy second hand (LOL).  Overall, I'm very happy with it!!

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…

For a refurbished phone, it looks brand new.  I was so glad to able to get an updated smartphone for just under $400 with plenty of space  (256MB).  Although it reads five stars, I reluctantly give it 4.85.  Only reason is because the battery health is at 86%. Yes I know that's still good, but would have been nice if it was above 90%, but hey you can't get everything when you buy second hand (LOL).  Overall, I'm very happy with it!!

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don

Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT.

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.Hope this helps!

So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don

Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.Hope this helps!

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.Hope this helps!

Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not!

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.Hope this helps!

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don

Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  Battery Health is 88% and stable.  Got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  Purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  Should have been my first stop..Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  So in the return box this goes.Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts.  Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.Hope this helps!

You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.The challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone.  - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.Hope this helps!

What I received is a very clean phone, fully functional with no visible marks and 100% battery life. Will update if I have any issues, but not concerned at the moment.

In 2022, I decided to switch to Apple because I respected some of their corporate governance and wanted to reward them, so I started out with this device.  WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK.  Touch stinks.  Autocorrect stinks.  Predictive text stinks.  Voice stinks.  Hardware problems, including battery charging problems.  Didn't yet have haptic feedback when I bought it in 2022!  Can't select and paste partial text from messages... Even the Apple case I bought cracked the first time I tried to take the phone out again.  The first time I went to set an alarm, I couldn't use the clock.. I had to go to Sleep app, sign in, then it redirected me to another Health app, and another sign-in, just to set up the first alarm.  I should have stopped there.The learning curve from Android to Apple was very easy, but the device and its function are WEAK.  Keep working on your cameras and emojis, Apple.  That's what Steve Jobs would want - not quality and innovation.... I have so many daily frustrations with this thing, I absolutely hate it and I will ***  N E V E R  *** buy another Apple product for my own use.  The only way I could see this being of any value is if you have every aspect of your life integrated with Apple devices and applications...  but that seems like a longshot, given this chunk of garbage.I am switching back to Android as soon as this POS breaks down completely, which I anticipate will be very soon.

But I broke my phone right before Thanksgiving and had very limited options -- this one was the best value for what I was looking for.Delivery came exactly on time (5 days with the holiday). The phone was admittedly a little dirty - some fingerprints on the edges, the speaker was dusty - but that was an easy fix. Was it annoying to have to clean it? Yeah, they should come already cleaned (that's why it gets 4 stars) but -- hey, I needed this phone.There are like two barely visible scratches on the screen; you can't even see them from arm's distance (holding your phone at normal length). You can only see them if you're looking for them and they're smaller than a cat hair. I'm totally happy with that.Phone is in great condition, started up fine, everything works. I just popped my SIM card in from my old phone and didn't have a single minute of disrupted phone service; everything transferred over fine. I will say I checked the battery life and it's at 89% which is more than the 80% guaranteed!

In 2022, I decided to switch to Apple because I respected some of their corporate governance and wanted to reward them, so I started out with this device.  WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK.  Touch stinks.  Autocorrect stinks.  Predictive text stinks.  Voice stinks.  Hardware problems, including battery charging problems.  Didn't yet have haptic feedback when I bought it in 2022!  Can't select and paste partial text from messages... Even the Apple case I bought cracked the first time I tried to take the phone out again.  The first time I went to set an alarm, I couldn't use the clock.. I had to go to Sleep app, sign in, then it redirected me to another Health app, and another sign-in, just to set up the first alarm.  I should have stopped there.The learning curve from Android to Apple was very easy, but the device and its function are WEAK.  Keep working on your cameras and emojis, Apple.  That's what Steve Jobs would want - not quality and innovation.... I have so many daily frustrations with this thing, I absolutely hate it and I will ***  N E V E R  *** buy another Apple product for my own use.  The only way I could see this being of any value is if you have every aspect of your life integrated with Apple devices and applications...  but that seems like a longshot, given this chunk of garbage.I am switching back to Android as soon as this POS breaks down completely, which I anticipate will be very soon.

But I broke my phone right before Thanksgiving and had very limited options -- this one was the best value for what I was looking for.Delivery came exactly on time (5 days with the holiday). The phone was admittedly a little dirty - some fingerprints on the edges, the speaker was dusty - but that was an easy fix. Was it annoying to have to clean it? Yeah, they should come already cleaned (that's why it gets 4 stars) but -- hey, I needed this phone.There are like two barely visible scratches on the screen; you can't even see them from arm's distance (holding your phone at normal length). You can only see them if you're looking for them and they're smaller than a cat hair. I'm totally happy with that.Phone is in great condition, started up fine, everything works. I just popped my SIM card in from my old phone and didn't have a single minute of disrupted phone service; everything transferred over fine. I will say I checked the battery life and it's at 89% which is more than the 80% guaranteed!

When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase

When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase

When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase

The exterior was clean, and the sides were spotless, except for a bit of dirt on the silencer and in the speakers, but nothing too concerning. The screen did have some minor scratches that were noticeable without a screen protector, but once the protector was on, they were hardly visible.The phone has the right amount of storage, exactly what I needed. The battery health is at 83%, which isn’t perfect but still acceptable for my usage. I was a bit disappointed when I realized my box didn’t come with a SIM card pin, especially after seeing other reviews mention it. All I received was the phone and a charger. Unfortunately, the charger was subpar, it has a shortage and is not a lightning charger. Thankfully, I had an extra charger on hand, so this issue wasn’t a dealbreaker for me.One small issue I’ve noticed is that the microphone seems to be a bit low when recording voice messages, so I find myself needing to speak louder than usual. However, the overall quality of the phone is good, and I haven’t encountered any major problems yet.I feel like this phone was a good value for the money. Despite the minor dirt and the low microphone volume, it came in excellent condition. Setting up the phone was easy, especially since I was moving from Android to iPhone. The Face ID works perfectly, and the regular passcode option adds extra security.I was initially worried about the camera quality since the phone is renewed, but I was pleasantly surprised, the camera quality is amazing. So far, so good!

When mine arrived I was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (Trust me I looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. I later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. The phone I got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the MSRP of this phone when it originally released, I was extremely happy. There were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: The packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: The setup process for the phone, I struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and I would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my Apple ID or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually I came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what I did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. One side note: I don’t believe this was a fault of the seller I think this was an Apple issue! After all, I got a brand new iPhone 13 Pro and I am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase

The exterior was clean, and the sides were spotless, except for a bit of dirt on the silencer and in the speakers, but nothing too concerning. The screen did have some minor scratches that were noticeable without a screen protector, but once the protector was on, they were hardly visible.The phone has the right amount of storage, exactly what I needed. The battery health is at 83%, which isn’t perfect but still acceptable for my usage. I was a bit disappointed when I realized my box didn’t come with a SIM card pin, especially after seeing other reviews mention it. All I received was the phone and a charger. Unfortunately, the charger was subpar, it has a shortage and is not a lightning charger. Thankfully, I had an extra charger on hand, so this issue wasn’t a dealbreaker for me.One small issue I’ve noticed is that the microphone seems to be a bit low when recording voice messages, so I find myself needing to speak louder than usual. However, the overall quality of the phone is good, and I haven’t encountered any major problems yet.I feel like this phone was a good value for the money. Despite the minor dirt and the low microphone volume, it came in excellent condition. Setting up the phone was easy, especially since I was moving from Android to iPhone. The Face ID works perfectly, and the regular passcode option adds extra security.I was initially worried about the camera quality since the phone is renewed, but I was pleasantly surprised, the camera quality is amazing. So far, so good!

There are plenty of those already.I bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as I don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. I bought from 'Hybrid IT' because they had like 99% positive ratings and I know refurbished can be hit and miss. And they had prime shipping.The one they sent was TERRIBLE. The screen was a fake LCD knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. Far below my already low expectations.I messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)They answer surprisingly quickly every time. Literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! I needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.It definitely exceeded my expectations. Almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. I think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. I would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one I got was not even up to par with Amazon's standards.I'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. Thanks Hybrid IT!!! Oh, and this isn't a fake review! A happy customer, crazy right???

I probably wouldn't have tried this with an online retailer other than Amazon or Apple.The supplier was TECHMINT, Amazon was only the purchase portal. There seems to be a number of 'Amazon-qualified suppliers' involved. To know who you're buying from, the 'ships from/sold by' info. is on the right side of the product page. There may also be differences in packaging and accessories. Best to read through the advertising to know exactly what you're buying. Or contact the supplier before purchasing. Given that Amazon backs these purchases, not a concern.It arrived without scratches, dings, or apparent wear. Looks like new. That said, anyone buying a 'Renewed' phone should expect varying degrees of condition within the parameters of Amazon's advertising. I'd suggest buying a 'Renewed Premium' for your best chance of a like-new phone. I probably got lucky with a 'Renewed'.It shipped in *very* well designed and protective box designed for phones. Not likely to be damaged in transit short of extremely heavy crush damage. If you plan on shipping your phone or storing a back-up, I'd suggest keeping it. The box has spacers to accommodate different sizes. Kudos to the packaging engineers that designed this. Well done.It was delivered with 100% battery health which almost certainly means that the phone was opened up and the battery replaced. The likelihood of a 'renewed' 13 Mini arriving with battery health at 100% is slim to none. I assume that they did this because the phone was traded in with < 80% battery health. The advertising states that the phone will arrive with battery health of ≥ 80%.I ran two diagnostics to check functions. In both cases, no issues. One of the diagnostics is built into iOS. You'll need iOS 17 or later and not a beta release. Search for 'built in iPhone diagnostic' for instructions. There's another which makes doing this quite a bit easier. From the Apple app store search for 'Phone Doctor Plus'. It leans more towards being a function check vs a more sophisticated diagnostic but great for making sure everything works. There's a free and paid version. There are others but these are the only two I've tried.Alternatively, you can take it to an Apple store and ask them to do it for you. Your carrier may also have on-site diagnostic capability. Best to call ahead and ask.The advertising stated that an MFi certified charging/data cable ships with the phone. Mine shipped with a 3ft cloth jacketed USB C to Lightning charging cable. No branding or print on the cable, no included documentation, no packaging. It appears similar to what you sometimes see without packaging and hanging from peg racks in convenience stores.I have no reason to believe that the provided cable isn't MFi certified and from a reliable manufacturer but without more information, I'd suggest using an Apple product or something from a reliable aftermarket supplier such as Anker or Belkin. Look for 'MFi certified' especially if you want fast charging capability. There are reasons USB C cables can be pricey, especially those designed for high power delivery. Better safe than sorry.Mine shipped without a charger. I checked the interior packaging to be sure. I'd say the same about a charger as I did about the cable - MFi certified and from a reputable manufacturer - Apple, Anker, Belkin, etc. For the 13 Mini, Apple recommends a minimum of a 20 watt charger for optimal/fast charging. Apple's is about 20 dollars. It's also what Apple recommends for powering it's MagSafe accessory.Some suppliers advertise that a sim card removal tool is included. Mine didn't. If yours shipped with a sim card (mine did not), I'd suggest reading through the pros and cons of SIM vs eSIM. If eSIM meets your needs, I'd recommend removing the SIM and switching to eSIM. Switching to eSIM can be done in your phone's settings. No expertise or hardware required. Although unlikely if buying from an 'Amazon-qualified supplier' (I assume), SIM cards can be compromised. If you need a SIM card, best to get one from your carrier instead of a mystery SIM.You'll need a case. Without, it's not a matter of if you'll drop it but when. This is my second mini, the first an iPhone 12 Mini. Slippery and with a smaller form factor than other iPhones, very easy lose grip especially if you have large hands. Further, without a case the camera lenses and screen make contact with whatever surface you place them on.The Apple leather case has been my go-to for the last 3-4 iPhones. Very well designed, doesn't add significant bulk, no sharp edges and it slips into and out of a pocket easily. The drop protection has proven to be excellent. Great case for all but extreme circumstances. They're relatively pricey so If you're looking to save, there are often Amazon customer returns available at steeply discounted prices.The iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini cases are not interchangeable. I tried. The camera lens housings are different. The 12 mini case will not fit the 13 mini. The 13 mini case will fit the 12 mini but there will be a gap on the right side of the lens housing.Not to overstate it but If you're considering both the 12 mini and 13 mini, battery life may be problematic for heavy users. True of all phones but somewhat more so for a Mini. If you have a full size phone with a larger battery at ≥ 90% battery health (guesstimate) and often find yourself scrambling to find a charger, the Mini may not be for you.If you're on the move a lot without convenient charging options, a small MagSafe power bank (≤ 5000mAh) will bring some peace of mind and a lot of convenience. Great when traveling. Definitely stick with time tested manufacturers. Anker and Belkin sell a wide variety. Note that the TSA only allows powerbanks in carry-ons.Apple discontinued it's iPhone powerbanks (Magsafe Battery Pack). As of this writing, you can still find them new from third party sources such as Walmart online. Never buy used. There are confirmed and very convincing counterfeits out there so I'd be cautious about which supplier you choose.If you're looking at both the 12 and 13 Minis, the 13 Mini uses an A15 processor which is somewhat more energy efficient and slightly faster. It also has a slightly larger battery. There are other differences including an upgraded camera.Compared to the 12 Mini, I found the differences to be almost insignificant in day to day use. Having a ~10% larger battery is nice but given my usage habits, rarely something that makes a difference. Long term, the 13 Mini will receive system updates from Apple for about a year longer. This may be the most value added difference.There are a lot of comparison reviews. Worth checking out before buying. Search for ""iPhone 13 mini vs iPhone 12 mini"".Happy customer. I'm fully committed to the Mini form factor/dimensions. I carry it all day in a front or back pocket and barely know it's there. When I need to replace it, perhaps Mini's will be back in the menu from Apple. Hope so.

There are plenty of those already.I bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as I don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. I bought from 'Hybrid IT' because they had like 99% positive ratings and I know refurbished can be hit and miss. And they had prime shipping.The one they sent was TERRIBLE. The screen was a fake LCD knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. Far below my already low expectations.I messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)They answer surprisingly quickly every time. Literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! I needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.It definitely exceeded my expectations. Almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. I think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. I would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one I got was not even up to par with Amazon's standards.I'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. Thanks Hybrid IT!!! Oh, and this isn't a fake review! A happy customer, crazy right???

There are plenty of those already.I bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as I don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. I bought from 'Hybrid IT' because they had like 99% positive ratings and I know refurbished can be hit and miss. And they had prime shipping.The one they sent was TERRIBLE. The screen was a fake LCD knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. Far below my already low expectations.I messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)They answer surprisingly quickly every time. Literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! I needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.It definitely exceeded my expectations. Almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. I think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. I would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one I got was not even up to par with Amazon's standards.I'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. Thanks Hybrid IT!!! Oh, and this isn't a fake review! A happy customer, crazy right???

Seemed to be a long waiting list. I finally gave up and went with a 'Renewed' advertised in excellent condition. Given Amazon's generous return policy, returning it would have been easy if there had been issues. I probably wouldn't have tried this with an online retailer other than Amazon or Apple.The supplier was TECHMINT, Amazon was only the purchase portal. There seems to be a number of 'Amazon-qualified suppliers' involved. To know who you're buying from, the 'ships from/sold by' info. is on the right side of the product page. There may also be differences in packaging and accessories. Best to read through the advertising to know exactly what you're buying. Or contact the supplier before purchasing. Given that Amazon backs these purchases, not a concern.It arrived without scratches, dings, or apparent wear. Looks like new. That said, anyone buying a 'Renewed' phone should expect varying degrees of condition within the parameters of Amazon's advertising. I'd suggest buying a 'Renewed Premium' for your best chance of a like-new phone. I probably got lucky with a 'Renewed'.It shipped in *very* well designed and protective box designed for phones. Not likely to be damaged in transit short of extremely heavy crush damage. If you plan on shipping your phone or storing a back-up, I'd suggest keeping it. The box has spacers to accommodate different sizes. Kudos to the packaging engineers that designed this. Well done.It was delivered with 100% battery health which almost certainly means that the phone was opened up and the battery replaced. The likelihood of a 'renewed' 13 Mini arriving with battery health at 100% is slim to none. I assume that they did this because the phone was traded in with < 80% battery health. The advertising states that the phone will arrive with battery health of ≥ 80%.I ran two diagnostics to check functions. In both cases, no issues. One of the diagnostics is built into iOS. You'll need iOS 17 or later and not a beta release. Search for 'built in iPhone diagnostic' for instructions. There's another which makes doing this quite a bit easier. From the Apple app store search for 'Phone Doctor Plus'. It leans more towards being a function check vs a more sophisticated diagnostic but great for making sure everything works. There's a free and paid version. There are others but these are the only two I've tried.Alternatively, you can take it to an Apple store and ask them to do it for you. Your carrier may also have on-site diagnostic capability. Best to call ahead and ask.The advertising stated that an MFi certified charging/data cable ships with the phone. Mine shipped with a 3ft cloth jacketed USB C to Lightning charging cable. No branding or print on the cable, no included documentation, no packaging. It appears similar to what you sometimes see without packaging and hanging from peg racks in convenience stores.I have no reason to believe that the provided cable isn't MFi certified and from a reliable manufacturer but without more information, I'd suggest using an Apple product or something from a reliable aftermarket supplier such as Anker or Belkin. Look for 'MFi certified' especially if you want fast charging capability. There are reasons USB C cables can be pricey, especially those designed for high power delivery. Better safe than sorry.Mine shipped without a charger. I checked the interior packaging to be sure. I'd say the same about a charger as I did about the cable - MFi certified and from a reputable manufacturer - Apple, Anker, Belkin, etc. For the 13 Mini, Apple recommends a minimum of a 20 watt charger for optimal/fast charging. Apple's is about 20 dollars. It's also what Apple recommends for powering it's MagSafe accessory.Some suppliers advertise that a sim card removal tool is included. Mine didn't. If yours shipped with a sim card (mine did not), I'd suggest reading through the pros and cons of SIM vs eSIM. If eSIM meets your needs, I'd recommend removing the SIM and switching to eSIM. Switching to eSIM can be done in your phone's settings. No expertise or hardware required. Although unlikely if buying from an 'Amazon-qualified supplier' (I assume), SIM cards can be compromised. If you need a SIM card, best to get one from your carrier instead of a mystery SIM.You'll need a case. Without, it's not a matter of if you'll drop it but when. This is my second mini, the first an iPhone 12 Mini. Slippery and with a smaller form factor than other iPhones, very easy lose grip especially if you have large hands. Further, without a case the camera lenses and screen make contact with whatever surface you place them on.The Apple leather case has been my go-to for the last 3-4 iPhones. Very well designed, doesn't add significant bulk, no sharp edges and it slips into and out of a pocket easily. The drop protection has proven to be excellent. Great case for all but extreme circumstances. They're relatively pricey so If you're looking to save, there are often Amazon customer returns available at steeply discounted prices.The iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini cases are not interchangeable. I tried. The camera lens housings are different. The 12 mini case will not fit the 13 mini. The 13 mini case will fit the 12 mini but there will be a gap on the right side of the lens housing.Not to overstate it but If you're considering both the 12 mini and 13 mini, battery life may be problematic for heavy users. True of all phones but somewhat more so for a Mini. If you have a full size phone with a larger battery at ≥ 90% battery health (guesstimate) and often find yourself scrambling to find a charger, the Mini may not be for you.If you're on the move a lot without convenient charging options, a small MagSafe power bank (≤ 5000mAh) will bring some peace of mind and a lot of convenience. Great when traveling. Definitely stick with time tested manufacturers. Anker and Belkin sell a wide variety. Note that the TSA only allows powerbanks in carry-ons.Apple discontinued it's iPhone powerbanks (Magsafe Battery Pack). As of this writing, you can still find them new from third party sources such as Walmart online. Never buy used. There are confirmed and very convincing counterfeits out there so I'd be cautious about which supplier you choose.If you're looking at both the 12 and 13 Minis, the 13 Mini uses an A15 processor which is somewhat more energy efficient and slightly faster. It also has a slightly larger battery. There are other differences including an upgraded camera.Compared to the 12 Mini, I found the differences to be almost insignificant in day to day use. Having a ~10% larger battery is nice but given my usage habits, rarely something that makes a difference. Long term, the 13 Mini will receive system updates from Apple for about a year longer. This may be the most value added difference.There are a lot of comparison reviews. Worth checking out before buying. Search for ""iPhone 13 mini vs iPhone 12 mini"".Happy customer. I'm fully committed to the Mini form factor/dimensions. I carry it all day in a front or back pocket and barely know it's there. When I need to replace it, perhaps Mini's will be back in the menu from Apple. Hope so.

There are plenty of those already.I bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as I don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. I bought from 'Hybrid IT' because they had like 99% positive ratings and I know refurbished can be hit and miss. And they had prime shipping.The one they sent was TERRIBLE. The screen was a fake LCD knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. Far below my already low expectations.I messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)They answer surprisingly quickly every time. Literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! I needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.It definitely exceeded my expectations. Almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. I think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. I would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one I got was not even up to par with Amazon's standards.I'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. Thanks Hybrid IT!!! Oh, and this isn't a fake review! A happy customer, crazy right???

Seemed to be a long waiting list. I finally gave up and went with a 'Renewed' advertised in excellent condition. Given Amazon's generous return policy, returning it would have been easy if there had been issues. I probably wouldn't have tried this with an online retailer other than Amazon or Apple.The supplier was TECHMINT, Amazon was only the purchase portal. There seems to be a number of 'Amazon-qualified suppliers' involved. To know who you're buying from, the 'ships from/sold by' info. is on the right side of the product page. There may also be differences in packaging and accessories. Best to read through the advertising to know exactly what you're buying. Or contact the supplier before purchasing. Given that Amazon backs these purchases, not a concern.It arrived without scratches, dings, or apparent wear. Looks like new. That said, anyone buying a 'Renewed' phone should expect varying degrees of condition within the parameters of Amazon's advertising. I'd suggest buying a 'Renewed Premium' for your best chance of a like-new phone. I probably got lucky with a 'Renewed'.It shipped in *very* well designed and protective box designed for phones. Not likely to be damaged in transit short of extremely heavy crush damage. If you plan on shipping your phone or storing a back-up, I'd suggest keeping it. The box has spacers to accommodate different sizes. Kudos to the packaging engineers that designed this. Well done.It was delivered with 100% battery health which almost certainly means that the phone was opened up and the battery replaced. The likelihood of a 'renewed' 13 Mini arriving with battery health at 100% is slim to none. I assume that they did this because the phone was traded in with < 80% battery health. The advertising states that the phone will arrive with battery health of ≥ 80%.I ran two diagnostics to check functions. In both cases, no issues. One of the diagnostics is built into iOS. You'll need iOS 17 or later and not a beta release. Search for 'built in iPhone diagnostic' for instructions. There's another which makes doing this quite a bit easier. From the Apple app store search for 'Phone Doctor Plus'. It leans more towards being a function check vs a more sophisticated diagnostic but great for making sure everything works. There's a free and paid version. There are others but these are the only two I've tried.Alternatively, you can take it to an Apple store and ask them to do it for you. Your carrier may also have on-site diagnostic capability. Best to call ahead and ask.The advertising stated that an MFi certified charging/data cable ships with the phone. Mine shipped with a 3ft cloth jacketed USB C to Lightning charging cable. No branding or print on the cable, no included documentation, no packaging. It appears similar to what you sometimes see without packaging and hanging from peg racks in convenience stores.I have no reason to believe that the provided cable isn't MFi certified and from a reliable manufacturer but without more information, I'd suggest using an Apple product or something from a reliable aftermarket supplier such as Anker or Belkin. Look for 'MFi certified' especially if you want fast charging capability. There are reasons USB C cables can be pricey, especially those designed for high power delivery. Better safe than sorry.Mine shipped without a charger. I checked the interior packaging to be sure. I'd say the same about a charger as I did about the cable - MFi certified and from a reputable manufacturer - Apple, Anker, Belkin, etc. For the 13 Mini, Apple recommends a minimum of a 20 watt charger for optimal/fast charging. Apple's is about 20 dollars. It's also what Apple recommends for powering it's MagSafe accessory.Some suppliers advertise that a sim card removal tool is included. Mine didn't. If yours shipped with a sim card (mine did not), I'd suggest reading through the pros and cons of SIM vs eSIM. If eSIM meets your needs, I'd recommend removing the SIM and switching to eSIM. Switching to eSIM can be done in your phone's settings. No expertise or hardware required. Although unlikely if buying from an 'Amazon-qualified supplier' (I assume), SIM cards can be compromised. If you need a SIM card, best to get one from your carrier instead of a mystery SIM.You'll need a case. Without, it's not a matter of if you'll drop it but when. This is my second mini, the first an iPhone 12 Mini. Slippery and with a smaller form factor than other iPhones, very easy lose grip especially if you have large hands. Further, without a case the camera lenses and screen make contact with whatever surface you place them on.The Apple leather case has been my go-to for the last 3-4 iPhones. Very well designed, doesn't add significant bulk, no sharp edges and it slips into and out of a pocket easily. The drop protection has proven to be excellent. Great case for all but extreme circumstances. They're relatively pricey so If you're looking to save, there are often Amazon customer returns available at steeply discounted prices.The iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini cases are not interchangeable. I tried. The camera lens housings are different. The 12 mini case will not fit the 13 mini. The 13 mini case will fit the 12 mini but there will be a gap on the right side of the lens housing.Not to overstate it but If you're considering both the 12 mini and 13 mini, battery life may be problematic for heavy users. True of all phones but somewhat more so for a Mini. If you have a full size phone with a larger battery at ≥ 90% battery health (guesstimate) and often find yourself scrambling to find a charger, the Mini may not be for you.If you're on the move a lot without convenient charging options, a small MagSafe power bank (≤ 5000mAh) will bring some peace of mind and a lot of convenience. Great when traveling. Definitely stick with time tested manufacturers. Anker and Belkin sell a wide variety. Note that the TSA only allows powerbanks in carry-ons.Apple discontinued it's iPhone powerbanks (Magsafe Battery Pack). As of this writing, you can still find them new from third party sources such as Walmart online. Never buy used. There are confirmed and very convincing counterfeits out there so I'd be cautious about which supplier you choose.If you're looking at both the 12 and 13 Minis, the 13 Mini uses an A15 processor which is somewhat more energy efficient and slightly faster. It also has a slightly larger battery. There are other differences including an upgraded camera.Compared to the 12 Mini, I found the differences to be almost insignificant in day to day use. Having a ~10% larger battery is nice but given my usage habits, rarely something that makes a difference. Long term, the 13 Mini will receive system updates from Apple for about a year longer. This may be the most value added difference.There are a lot of comparison reviews. Worth checking out before buying. Search for ""iPhone 13 mini vs iPhone 12 mini"".Happy customer. I'm fully committed to the Mini form factor/dimensions. I carry it all day in a front or back pocket and barely know it's there. When I need to replace it, perhaps Mini's will be back in the menu from Apple. Hope so.

I have always been an Android user.Well, it’s interesting. It is pretty simple to use.I like the quality.There are only two things I don’t like about Apple, and say Android does have a leg up on over Apple.1) no side loading of apps (unless jail broken)2) not SD card slot.As for side loading, as I hear, it will be possible in the UK…but not in the US.So for this, it will probably be my only iPhone I purchase, UNLESS side loading (third party) apps will come to iPhone in the great USA 🇺🇸I also am not a fan of no expandable storage(SD card) but I still have plenty of space left on the phone.I’m relatively conflicted on this purchase.On my android 🤖 I have had a bunch of third party apps, and now I longer can’t have that luxury. It is a real bummer if you are a android user that does side load apps(third party apps)But the phone quality is great, it’s sleek, it’s quick, and it takes great photos 🤷🏻‍♂️Oh yeah, just don’t drop your phone at all if you want to use phone recognition. It will no longer work.I dropped my phone a couple feet off the ground ONE TIME and now phone recognition does not work. Lame.Phone durability 👎🏻No side loading 👎🏻No expandable storage 👎🏻3/5.

I have always been an Android user.Well, it’s interesting. It is pretty simple to use.I like the quality.There are only two things I don’t like about Apple, and say Android does have a leg up on over Apple.1) no side loading of apps (unless jail broken)2) not SD card slot.As for side loading, as I hear, it will be possible in the UK…but not in the US.So for this, it will probably be my only iPhone I purchase, UNLESS side loading (third party) apps will come to iPhone in the great USA 🇺🇸I also am not a fan of no expandable storage(SD card) but I still have plenty of space left on the phone.I’m relatively conflicted on this purchase.On my android 🤖 I have had a bunch of third party apps, and now I longer can’t have that luxury. It is a real bummer if you are a android user that does side load apps(third party apps)But the phone quality is great, it’s sleek, it’s quick, and it takes great photos 🤷🏻‍♂️Oh yeah, just don’t drop your phone at all if you want to use phone recognition. It will no longer work.I dropped my phone a couple feet off the ground ONE TIME and now phone recognition does not work. Lame.Phone durability 👎🏻No side loading 👎🏻No expandable storage 👎🏻3/5.

Was a little skeptical due to me purchasing a MacBook Pro on Amazon renew and it not working but I am impressed. It actually arrived earlier than projected and was nicely packaged. Zero scratches or chips from what I can see from the naked eye. Cameras work perfect and look amazing. Battery lasts a while despite it being on 84% health, which would probably be my only complaint but even then it’s not bad tbh especially for renewed. Came with fast charger but no box sadly. Got everything switched over very quick and easy and currently have zero complaints. The screen has no scratches and honeslty looks brand new. Really impressed and happy with this purchase!

Was a little skeptical due to me purchasing a MacBook Pro on Amazon renew and it not working but I am impressed. It actually arrived earlier than projected and was nicely packaged. Zero scratches or chips from what I can see from the naked eye. Cameras work perfect and look amazing. Battery lasts a while despite it being on 84% health, which would probably be my only complaint but even then it’s not bad tbh especially for renewed. Came with fast charger but no box sadly. Got everything switched over very quick and easy and currently have zero complaints. The screen has no scratches and honeslty looks brand new. Really impressed and happy with this purchase!

Said it could not verify login.  Super frustrating but decided to return and try a different phone. Amazon only offered a return if I can drop it off at Whole Foods. Usually I drop returns at ups store or even ship it myself if necessary. I contacted customer service to get another option for return but they said Whole Foods is the only option. Not sure why I would drive almost an hour (round trip) to return something that’s defective. Haven’t ever had this problem before. Hopefully we can get this return processed asap.

I bought one first from someone else and it was an awful experience. This seller has taken such good care of me that it softens the blow of dealing with the other company. I had bought a phone in “excellent “ condition and it was defective. Can I believe they expected me to wipe my info from the phone , send it back and wait on their generosity to send me another one. The other choice was buy another phone and wait 30 days on credit.Thank goodness I found this seller.The phone was just like brand new! It was packaged beyond expectations. Looked like it could have come straight from apple.I don’t have to tell u about iPhone features. Just look at description and that’s what u get or better. The battery life is 100%. It arrived before I could turn around. I couldn’t take a pic cause I’m on the phone. LolI’m still waiting however on Amazon to acknowledge they received my trade in. That my friends is a whole other ball of wax.I’m so happy with my phone that I just ordered another one for my son

It charges super fast with the charger it comes with and the battery lasts all day. It has some choices of some very nice colors, but I choose white to match the case I bought for it. It easily connects to your phone provider, your wifi, and any wireless headphones you may want to use.

I bought one first from someone else and it was an awful experience. This seller has taken such good care of me that it softens the blow of dealing with the other company. I had bought a phone in “excellent “ condition and it was defective. Can I believe they expected me to wipe my info from the phone , send it back and wait on their generosity to send me another one. The other choice was buy another phone and wait 30 days on credit.Thank goodness I found this seller.The phone was just like brand new! It was packaged beyond expectations. Looked like it could have come straight from apple.I don’t have to tell u about iPhone features. Just look at description and that’s what u get or better. The battery life is 100%. It arrived before I could turn around. I couldn’t take a pic cause I’m on the phone. LolI’m still waiting however on Amazon to acknowledge they received my trade in.

Usually I drop returns at ups store or even ship it myself if necessary. I contacted customer service to get another option for return but they said Whole Foods is the only option. Not sure why I would drive almost an hour (round trip) to return something that’s defective. Haven’t ever had this problem before. Hopefully we can get this return processed asap.

I brought it to my carrier to transfer phones numbers, had some trouble setting it up at first but I figured it out on my own, which can be disheartening to some but here’s the pros and cons.Pros:-Cosmetically great | Saw no huge scratches or marks on the phone, if so, they’re probably REALLY minor.-Pre-installed screen protector | The seller I bought it from was called “GSMFORALL” it was nice of them to do it for me instead of doing myself, which I wouldn’t have minded but it was awesome of them to include that in!-Safe Packaging |  phone came in bubble rap sleeve when I opened it, can be considered standard but I liked that they included it.Battery Life | Battery works just fine, charges up to 100% easily.Cons:-Cheap charging chord | Cheap lightning charger, the box it fine but the charger head was loose 3rd day into using it, I would recommend getting an actual apple branded lighting chord or a braided one from a third party seller.-Trouble registering for iCloud Account | This only really applies if you’re a first time Apple user (Like Me) and needs to create an iCloud account, took it to my carrier to transfer numbers which they did just fine, but I had to call Apple support at home to troubleshoot the problem with a message displaying that I could not verify my phone number, had to erase my safari history. The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I’ve already owned one. But I can say I’m happy owning an iPhone! :)

If Amazon sends you the wrong phone by mistake, expect at least two hours with support to get it resolved.It sucks to have to write a negative review about a bad experience with Amazon, but this is the world we live in. Quick summary: I purchased this iPhone 14 Pro Max from the Amazon Renewed store. What I received was this yellow iPhone XR as shown in the photo. A whole lot of suckiness; however, it assuredly gets worse.I reached out to Amazon's customer service because I figured it was as simple as them saying, ""Oh, whoops! We messed up! We'll send you a replacement and you can send us the wrong one back. Here's a li'l credit for your trouble because we biffed it!"" Sike!The first rep told me he couldn't replace it because it was a third party item - which was wrong, as I bought it from Amazon directly as part of their Renewed store. The rep told me to just buy another one, send the old one back, and then they'll refund me for the purchase of the flubbed-up phone. To be clear: I had to pay, up front, another $900 for a replacement phone and wait until I returned the old phone to get a refund. To make things even stankier, the iPhone 14 Pro Max went up $84 since my purchase. When I mentioned that to the rep, he gave me one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I escalated up the chain to a supervisor, who parroted the first guy's response. Again, they want me to pay up front for a replacement phone plus an extra $84 for the new purchase price. The supervisor had a little more pull, so I negotiated for a credit for the price difference. This was after around an hour in their chat.Here's another thing that Amazon shrugged about: I have to be home to hand deliver the return to a UPS driver. I can't drop it off somewhere, or print my own label and take it to UPS, or put it in a UPS drop-off container. As someone who works during the day, I'm not able to be home to do this. ""Oh, they'll just leave a label at your door if you're not there,""  the supervisor says. To recap: I cannot print my own label, but a UPS driver will come to my house and leave one for me if I'm not there to give him the package.To recap:- I purchased an iPhone 14 Max Pro from Amazon and received the wrong phone.- Amazon would not send me a replacement, rather they asked me to re-purchase the phone at a higher price.- I had to negotiate with a supervisor in order to get a credit for the cost of the phone.- I cannot print the replacement label for the wrong phone and take it somewhere, but rather a UPS driver has to come to my house and physically take the package from me. Only then will I get a refund for the wrong phone.This was an exciting purchase turned sour. It was enough to give a normal person anxiety and to make an anxious person spiral out of control. Buy at your own risk, or not at all.

It was a better way to get Dynamic Island and some of the new features that the newer phones have without breaking the bank. This is the first “big” iPhone I’ve ever had and I’d say I like it. Couple of small scratches around the frame and one decent dent at the bottom corner of the frame but I’d say the overall condition for a used phone is in perfect condition. I see on the repair history that a new screen was put on: this explains why this phone was “refurbished”.  Maximuim battery capacity is 88 percent, but I’m probably going to just schedule a replacement at my nearest Best Buy and keep this phone for at least a year before I upgrade again if it permits me to do so. Overall good, couple light cosmetic issues, and price for a phone that allows me into the new features good, so I’d say overall this one gets 4 stars.

I brought it to my carrier to transfer phones numbers, had some trouble setting it up at first but I figured it out on my own, which can be disheartening to some but here’s the pros and cons.Pros:-Cosmetically great | Saw no huge scratches or marks on the phone, if so, they’re probably REALLY minor.-Pre-installed screen protector | The seller I bought it from was called “GSMFORALL” it was nice of them to do it for me instead of doing myself, which I wouldn’t have minded but it was awesome of them to include that in!-Safe Packaging |  phone came in bubble rap sleeve when I opened it, can be considered standard but I liked that they included it.Battery Life | Battery works just fine, charges up to 100% easily.Cons:-Cheap charging chord | Cheap lightning charger, the box it fine but the charger head was loose 3rd day into using it, I would recommend getting an actual apple branded lighting chord or a braided one from a third party seller.-Trouble registering for iCloud Account | This only really applies if you’re a first time Apple user (Like Me) and needs to create an iCloud account, took it to my carrier to transfer numbers which they did just fine, but I had to call Apple support at home to troubleshoot the problem with a message displaying that I could not verify my phone number, had to erase my safari history. The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I’ve already owned one. But I can say I’m happy owning an iPhone! :)

If Amazon sends you the wrong phone by mistake, expect at least two hours with support to get it resolved.It sucks to have to write a negative review about a bad experience with Amazon, but this is the world we live in. Quick summary: I purchased this iPhone 14 Pro Max from the Amazon Renewed store. What I received was this yellow iPhone XR as shown in the photo. A whole lot of suckiness; however, it assuredly gets worse.I reached out to Amazon's customer service because I figured it was as simple as them saying, ""Oh, whoops! We messed up! We'll send you a replacement and you can send us the wrong one back. Here's a li'l credit for your trouble because we biffed it!"" Sike!The first rep told me he couldn't replace it because it was a third party item - which was wrong, as I bought it from Amazon directly as part of their Renewed store. The rep told me to just buy another one, send the old one back, and then they'll refund me for the purchase of the flubbed-up phone. To be clear: I had to pay, up front, another $900 for a replacement phone and wait until I returned the old phone to get a refund. To make things even stankier, the iPhone 14 Pro Max went up $84 since my purchase. When I mentioned that to the rep, he gave me one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I escalated up the chain to a supervisor, who parroted the first guy's response. Again, they want me to pay up front for a replacement phone plus an extra $84 for the new purchase price. The supervisor had a little more pull, so I negotiated for a credit for the price difference. This was after around an hour in their chat.Here's another thing that Amazon shrugged about: I have to be home to hand deliver the return to a UPS driver. I can't drop it off somewhere, or print my own label and take it to UPS, or put it in a UPS drop-off container. As someone who works during the day, I'm not able to be home to do this. ""Oh, they'll just leave a label at your door if you're not there,""  the supervisor says. To recap: I cannot print my own label, but a UPS driver will come to my house and leave one for me if I'm not there to give him the package.To recap:- I purchased an iPhone 14 Max Pro from Amazon and received the wrong phone.- Amazon would not send me a replacement, rather they asked me to re-purchase the phone at a higher price.- I had to negotiate with a supervisor in order to get a credit for the cost of the phone.- I cannot print the replacement label for the wrong phone and take it somewhere, but rather a UPS driver has to come to my house and physically take the package from me. Only then will I get a refund for the wrong phone.This was an exciting purchase turned sour. It was enough to give a normal person anxiety and to make an anxious person spiral out of control. Buy at your own risk, or not at all.

It was a better way to get Dynamic Island and some of the new features that the newer phones have without breaking the bank. This is the first “big” iPhone I’ve ever had and I’d say I like it. Couple of small scratches around the frame and one decent dent at the bottom corner of the frame but I’d say the overall condition for a used phone is in perfect condition. I see on the repair history that a new screen was put on: this explains why this phone was “refurbished”.  Maximuim battery capacity is 88 percent, but I’m probably going to just schedule a replacement at my nearest Best Buy and keep this phone for at least a year before I upgrade again if it permits me to do so. Overall good, couple light cosmetic issues, and price for a phone that allows me into the new features good, so I’d say overall this one gets 4 stars.

I brought it to my carrier to transfer phones numbers, had some trouble setting it up at first but I figured it out on my own, which can be disheartening to some but here’s the pros and cons.Pros:-Cosmetically great | Saw no huge scratches or marks on the phone, if so, they’re probably REALLY minor.-Pre-installed screen protector | The seller I bought it from was called “GSMFORALL” it was nice of them to do it for me instead of doing myself, which I wouldn’t have minded but it was awesome of them to include that in!-Safe Packaging |  phone came in bubble rap sleeve when I opened it, can be considered standard but I liked that they included it.Battery Life | Battery works just fine, charges up to 100% easily.Cons:-Cheap charging chord | Cheap lightning charger, the box it fine but the charger head was loose 3rd day into using it, I would recommend getting an actual apple branded lighting chord or a braided one from a third party seller.-Trouble registering for iCloud Account | This only really applies if you’re a first time Apple user (Like Me) and needs to create an iCloud account, took it to my carrier to transfer numbers which they did just fine, but I had to call Apple support at home to troubleshoot the problem with a message displaying that I could not verify my phone number, had to erase my safari history. The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I’ve already owned one. But I can say I’m happy owning an iPhone! :)

If Amazon sends you the wrong phone by mistake, expect at least two hours with support to get it resolved.It sucks to have to write a negative review about a bad experience with Amazon, but this is the world we live in. Quick summary: I purchased this iPhone 14 Pro Max from the Amazon Renewed store. What I received was this yellow iPhone XR as shown in the photo. A whole lot of suckiness; however, it assuredly gets worse.I reached out to Amazon's customer service because I figured it was as simple as them saying, ""Oh, whoops! We messed up! We'll send you a replacement and you can send us the wrong one back. Here's a li'l credit for your trouble because we biffed it!"" Sike!The first rep told me he couldn't replace it because it was a third party item - which was wrong, as I bought it from Amazon directly as part of their Renewed store. The rep told me to just buy another one, send the old one back, and then they'll refund me for the purchase of the flubbed-up phone. To be clear: I had to pay, up front, another $900 for a replacement phone and wait until I returned the old phone to get a refund. To make things even stankier, the iPhone 14 Pro Max went up $84 since my purchase. When I mentioned that to the rep, he gave me one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I escalated up the chain to a supervisor, who parroted the first guy's response. Again, they want me to pay up front for a replacement phone plus an extra $84 for the new purchase price. The supervisor had a little more pull, so I negotiated for a credit for the price difference. This was after around an hour in their chat.Here's another thing that Amazon shrugged about: I have to be home to hand deliver the return to a UPS driver. I can't drop it off somewhere, or print my own label and take it to UPS, or put it in a UPS drop-off container. As someone who works during the day, I'm not able to be home to do this. ""Oh, they'll just leave a label at your door if you're not there,""  the supervisor says. To recap: I cannot print my own label, but a UPS driver will come to my house and leave one for me if I'm not there to give him the package.To recap:- I purchased an iPhone 14 Max Pro from Amazon and received the wrong phone.- Amazon would not send me a replacement, rather they asked me to re-purchase the phone at a higher price.- I had to negotiate with a supervisor in order to get a credit for the cost of the phone.- I cannot print the replacement label for the wrong phone and take it somewhere, but rather a UPS driver has to come to my house and physically take the package from me. Only then will I get a refund for the wrong phone.This was an exciting purchase turned sour. It was enough to give a normal person anxiety and to make an anxious person spiral out of control. Buy at your own risk, or not at all.

It was a better way to get Dynamic Island and some of the new features that the newer phones have without breaking the bank. This is the first “big” iPhone I’ve ever had and I’d say I like it. Couple of small scratches around the frame and one decent dent at the bottom corner of the frame but I’d say the overall condition for a used phone is in perfect condition. I see on the repair history that a new screen was put on: this explains why this phone was “refurbished”.  Maximuim battery capacity is 88 percent, but I’m probably going to just schedule a replacement at my nearest Best Buy and keep this phone for at least a year before I upgrade again if it permits me to do so. Overall good, couple light cosmetic issues, and price for a phone that allows me into the new features good, so I’d say overall this one gets 4 stars.

I brought it to my carrier to transfer phones numbers, had some trouble setting it up at first but I figured it out on my own, which can be disheartening to some but here’s the pros and cons.Pros:-Cosmetically great | Saw no huge scratches or marks on the phone, if so, they’re probably REALLY minor.-Pre-installed screen protector | The seller I bought it from was called “GSMFORALL” it was nice of them to do it for me instead of doing myself, which I wouldn’t have minded but it was awesome of them to include that in!-Safe Packaging |  phone came in bubble rap sleeve when I opened it, can be considered standard but I liked that they included it.Battery Life | Battery works just fine, charges up to 100% easily.Cons:-Cheap charging chord | Cheap lightning charger, the box it fine but the charger head was loose 3rd day into using it, I would recommend getting an actual apple branded lighting chord or a braided one from a third party seller.-Trouble registering for iCloud Account | This only really applies if you’re a first time Apple user (Like Me) and needs to create an iCloud account, took it to my carrier to transfer numbers which they did just fine, but I had to call Apple support at home to troubleshoot the problem with a message displaying that I could not verify my phone number, had to erase my safari history. The process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.Overall, owning an iPhone for the first time has been a great experience, I was debating on getting the S24 Ultra from Samsung because I’ve already owned one. But I can say I’m happy owning an iPhone! :)

If Amazon sends you the wrong phone by mistake, expect at least two hours with support to get it resolved.It sucks to have to write a negative review about a bad experience with Amazon, but this is the world we live in. Quick summary: I purchased this iPhone 14 Pro Max from the Amazon Renewed store. What I received was this yellow iPhone XR as shown in the photo. A whole lot of suckiness; however, it assuredly gets worse.I reached out to Amazon's customer service because I figured it was as simple as them saying, ""Oh, whoops! We messed up! We'll send you a replacement and you can send us the wrong one back. Here's a li'l credit for your trouble because we biffed it!"" Sike!The first rep told me he couldn't replace it because it was a third party item - which was wrong, as I bought it from Amazon directly as part of their Renewed store. The rep told me to just buy another one, send the old one back, and then they'll refund me for the purchase of the flubbed-up phone. To be clear: I had to pay, up front, another $900 for a replacement phone and wait until I returned the old phone to get a refund. To make things even stankier, the iPhone 14 Pro Max went up $84 since my purchase. When I mentioned that to the rep, he gave me one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I escalated up the chain to a supervisor, who parroted the first guy's response. Again, they want me to pay up front for a replacement phone plus an extra $84 for the new purchase price. The supervisor had a little more pull, so I negotiated for a credit for the price difference. This was after around an hour in their chat.Here's another thing that Amazon shrugged about: I have to be home to hand deliver the return to a UPS driver. I can't drop it off somewhere, or print my own label and take it to UPS, or put it in a UPS drop-off container. As someone who works during the day, I'm not able to be home to do this. ""Oh, they'll just leave a label at your door if you're not there,""  the supervisor says. To recap: I cannot print my own label, but a UPS driver will come to my house and leave one for me if I'm not there to give him the package.To recap:- I purchased an iPhone 14 Max Pro from Amazon and received the wrong phone.- Amazon would not send me a replacement, rather they asked me to re-purchase the phone at a higher price.- I had to negotiate with a supervisor in order to get a credit for the cost of the phone.- I cannot print the replacement label for the wrong phone and take it somewhere, but rather a UPS driver has to come to my house and physically take the package from me. Only then will I get a refund for the wrong phone.This was an exciting purchase turned sour. It was enough to give a normal person anxiety and to make an anxious person spiral out of control. Buy at your own risk, or not at all.

It was a better way to get Dynamic Island and some of the new features that the newer phones have without breaking the bank. This is the first “big” iPhone I’ve ever had and I’d say I like it. Couple of small scratches around the frame and one decent dent at the bottom corner of the frame but I’d say the overall condition for a used phone is in perfect condition. I see on the repair history that a new screen was put on: this explains why this phone was “refurbished”.  Maximuim battery capacity is 88 percent, but I’m probably going to just schedule a replacement at my nearest Best Buy and keep this phone for at least a year before I upgrade again if it permits me to do so. Overall good, couple light cosmetic issues, and price for a phone that allows me into the new features good, so I’d say overall this one gets 4 stars.

When I got to the store to look at it, the screen had a giant crack right down the center. I looked right at the cashier like that can hardly be considered excellent condition, imo it would be considered poor at best. So when I ordered the iPhone 14 Pro as a upgrade to my Samsung galaxy s9+ I was very concerned it would come in a terrible condition but everything ive bought second hand from amazon has been in the condition ordered. If it says excellent that means no marks or minimal. My phone arrived in nearly perfect condition. The screen and back glass are flawless, there is some slight scratching on the buttons but that's to be expected for a used device. All in all for $600 im very pleased with my purchase, this phone was brand new a year ago and it's fully unlocked. Insane deal for that price. Dont be worried about buying used from amazon, everything ive gotten from them has been 100% worth it.

 Disclaimer: I ordered this phone twice. All complaints go to the first phone, which was sent back. The second phone was kept and is great. The video is of the first phone (which was sent back) and all the other photos are of the second phone. I rate these phones: 5 stars for the second phone, 3 stars for the first oneOkay, so I received this phone and it was not packaged well at all. It came in an android box that was open and the phone had no secure place to sit (because it didn’t fit in that box) so it was sliding out/ halfway out the box when I opened the FedEx bag. It came with a screen protector on it. When the screen protector cracked, I took it off and there were so many scratches on the screen. There were also A LOT of scratches by the charging port, above the speakers, and on the edges of the phone. It came at 97% battery life and the function of the phone was totally fine. I wouldn’t say it was excellent condition at all, more like “good” or “okay” condition. I ended up sending this one back and reordering & received a brand new phone with no cosmetic defects and the phone at 100% battery life. Phone was not eligible for Apple care but is still under apples warranty.Also, I’m very unsure why people are leaving bad reviews because this phone has an eSIM and not an actual SIM card slot. Apple moved over to eSIM starting with the iPhone 14, so whenever you upgrade to the 14 or newer it is going to be an eSIM. It is literally the same thing as having a physical SIM card. When setting up the phone it is literally the same except you don’t put in a SIM card, it just makes you an eSIM when you transfer your number. It’s hassle free actually.

I know 87% is pretty close, but I was lied to so that’s very disappointing, especially since the first phone I bought wasn’t even checked and they sent me a blacklisted one, thankfully they keep their word about returns though! I wouldn’t buy a renewer phone from any of the 3rd parties for that reason. Stick with Amazon because at least you can return it!

 Disclaimer: I ordered this phone twice. All complaints go to the first phone, which was sent back. The second phone was kept and is great. The video is of the first phone (which was sent back) and all the other photos are of the second phone. I rate these phones: 5 stars for the second phone, 3 stars for the first oneOkay, so I received this phone and it was not packaged well at all. It came in an android box that was open and the phone had no secure place to sit (because it didn’t fit in that box) so it was sliding out/ halfway out the box when I opened the FedEx bag. It came with a screen protector on it. When the screen protector cracked, I took it off and there were so many scratches on the screen. There were also A LOT of scratches by the charging port, above the speakers, and on the edges of the phone. It came at 97% battery life and the function of the phone was totally fine. I wouldn’t say it was excellent condition at all, more like “good” or “okay” condition. I ended up sending this one back and reordering & received a brand new phone with no cosmetic defects and the phone at 100% battery life. Phone was not eligible for Apple care but is still under apples warranty.Also, I’m very unsure why people are leaving bad reviews because this phone has an eSIM and not an actual SIM card slot. Apple moved over to eSIM starting with the iPhone 14, so whenever you upgrade to the 14 or newer it is going to be an eSIM. It is literally the same thing as having a physical SIM card. When setting up the phone it is literally the same except you don’t put in a SIM card, it just makes you an eSIM when you transfer your number. It’s hassle free actually.

I know 87% is pretty close, but I was lied to so that’s very disappointing, especially since the first phone I bought wasn’t even checked and they sent me a blacklisted one, thankfully they keep their word about returns though! I wouldn’t buy a renewer phone from any of the 3rd parties for that reason. Stick with Amazon because at least you can return it!

However, there were a few aspects that determined how many stars this review would recieved. The phone itself was in good condition, there were a few smudges on the side, but that was wiped off easily. The little film that's on top of the phone was dirty, I didn't really mind about that though. The thing that really disappointed me was the battery life. The phone is 88% battery life. I would expect more from a one year old phone, but that's average after a year, I'd expect a higher battery life and I know I wouldn't get anything better if I replaced it. Another thing I didn't like was the cheap chinese brick and cable, in 5 minutes it wouldn't even go up by 1%! If you buy this product, make sure to buy a good cable and brick as well.In summary, the phone itself is good, the battery life however, was the only aspect that disappointed me.

However, there were a few aspects that determined how many stars this review would recieved. The phone itself was in good condition, there were a few smudges on the side, but that was wiped off easily. The little film that's on top of the phone was dirty, I didn't really mind about that though. The thing that really disappointed me was the battery life. The phone is 88% battery life. I would expect more from a one year old phone, but that's average after a year, I'd expect a higher battery life and I know I wouldn't get anything better if I replaced it. Another thing I didn't like was the cheap chinese brick and cable, in 5 minutes it wouldn't even go up by 1%! If you buy this product, make sure to buy a good cable and brick as well.In summary, the phone itself is good, the battery life however, was the only aspect that disappointed me.

When I got to the store to look at it, the screen had a giant crack right down the center. I looked right at the cashier like that can hardly be considered excellent condition, imo it would be considered poor at best. So when I ordered the iPhone 14 Pro as a upgrade to my Samsung galaxy s9+ I was very concerned it would come in a terrible condition but everything ive bought second hand from amazon has been in the condition ordered. If it says excellent that means no marks or minimal. My phone arrived in nearly perfect condition. The screen and back glass are flawless, there is some slight scratching on the buttons but that's to be expected for a used device. All in all for $600 im very pleased with my purchase, this phone was brand new a year ago and it's fully unlocked. Insane deal for that price. Dont be worried about buying used from amazon, everything ive gotten from them has been 100% worth it.

They stated the phone was in excellent condition/ like new, and it is. The battery percentage is 98%, that’s above excellent for a refinished IPhone. I would buy again if need be in the future. The iPhone 14 Plus is such a wonderful delight to use as I finally upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus. The new features are so easy to adjust to. It’s really nice to ask Siri to do a task, and “ Poof “ it’s done. Saves a lot of time and very useful in the car. I’m so glad I stepped out of the dinosaur era and upgraded. The phone charges very fast using the 20v plug and chord, or the affordable magnetic charging. You can use the magnetic charge through your phone case! I love the screen size of the iPhone 14 Plus! The phone is just about an 1/8 inch larger than my old phone, but the screen is bigger because there is no button, you just use swiping. The iPhone tips app shows you how to do everything you need to do in quick shortcuts, or you can read the users manual in your spare time. Siri helped me figure out how to get around by telling me how to do something before I was accustomed to the phone, and it only took a couple of minutes, and I became a novice user until I made it to the tips app. Thank you Apple for such a wonderful iPhone, and thank you seller for your honesty and air mail!

No scratches and so far is working wonderfully. I was able to swap my device with my carrier with no issues (Metro by T-mobile). Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the charging cable that came with the phone does not work. Sucks for me because I switched to the iphone from an android, so no extra charging cables laying around. Not a complete deal breaker though. I did get a good phone for a good price that works great. Luckily, I do have a wireless charging pad that I can use to charge the phone for the time being.

I put on a screen protector and the scratches are hardly noticeable. The function of the phone has been great, no function or other issues at all. The ""Excellent"" rating was fair in my opinion.There was a little funny happened though, they sent me both the 14 plus AND the next day I received a 13, almost like a BOGO sale. I contacted them and they sent me a return address label.Overall, I'd call it a win.

I saved sooo much money going through Amazon. I went into metro to see about an upgrade and the same phone would’ve cost like almost $800 plus tax, even for someone who’s been a customer for 5 years without an upgrade in 3 years. They refused to give me a discounted rate, which I found to be ridiculous—I suspect because I am locked into a $35/mo plan and they wanted me to switch to the $70/mo plan for the upgrade price. Yeah right lol. I highly recommend going this route. You will save so much money in the long run.

No scratches and so far is working wonderfully. I was able to swap my device with my carrier with no issues (Metro by T-mobile). Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the charging cable that came with the phone does not work. Sucks for me because I switched to the iphone from an android, so no extra charging cables laying around. Not a complete deal breaker though. I did get a good phone for a good price that works great. Luckily, I do have a wireless charging pad that I can use to charge the phone for the time being.

I put on a screen protector and the scratches are hardly noticeable. The function of the phone has been great, no function or other issues at all. The ""Excellent"" rating was fair in my opinion.There was a little funny happened though, they sent me both the 14 plus AND the next day I received a 13, almost like a BOGO sale. I contacted them and they sent me a return address label.Overall, I'd call it a win.

The battery health is 100%. It was a breeze to set up! I did have to go into metro for the eSIM because my iPhone 11 was too old but that’s not the seller’s fault lol. I saved sooo much money going through Amazon. I went into metro to see about an upgrade and the same phone would’ve cost like almost $800 plus tax, even for someone who’s been a customer for 5 years without an upgrade in 3 years. They refused to give me a discounted rate, which I found to be ridiculous—I suspect because I am locked into a $35/mo plan and they wanted me to switch to the $70/mo plan for the upgrade price. Yeah right lol. I highly recommend going this route. You will save so much money in the long run.

The battery health is 100%. It was a breeze to set up! I did have to go into metro for the eSIM because my iPhone 11 was too old but that’s not the seller’s fault lol. I saved sooo much money going through Amazon. I went into metro to see about an upgrade and the same phone would’ve cost like almost $800 plus tax, even for someone who’s been a customer for 5 years without an upgrade in 3 years. They refused to give me a discounted rate, which I found to be ridiculous—I suspect because I am locked into a $35/mo plan and they wanted me to switch to the $70/mo plan for the upgrade price. Yeah right lol. I highly recommend going this route. You will save so much money in the long run.

The iPhone 14 Plus is such a wonderful delight to use as I finally upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus. The new features are so easy to adjust to. It’s really nice to ask Siri to do a task, and “ Poof “ it’s done. Saves a lot of time and very useful in the car. I’m so glad I stepped out of the dinosaur era and upgraded. The phone charges very fast using the 20v plug and chord, or the affordable magnetic charging. You can use the magnetic charge through your phone case! I love the screen size of the iPhone 14 Plus! The phone is just about an 1/8 inch larger than my old phone, but the screen is bigger because there is no button, you just use swiping. The iPhone tips app shows you how to do everything you need to do in quick shortcuts, or you can read the users manual in your spare time.

I saved sooo much money going through Amazon. I went into metro to see about an upgrade and the same phone would’ve cost like almost $800 plus tax, even for someone who’s been a customer for 5 years without an upgrade in 3 years. They refused to give me a discounted rate, which I found to be ridiculous—I suspect because I am locked into a $35/mo plan and they wanted me to switch to the $70/mo plan for the upgrade price. Yeah right lol. I highly recommend going this route. You will save so much money in the long run.

So, again, no problem.I'm still  trying to adjust from my old  android  o my  new  Apple O phone S; but at  86, I'm slower than some in learning.  However  it appears easier than I'd assumed -given I've been balking for years about my unwillingness to o  ""learn a new operating system"".  But so many people had told  me that Apple's Accessibility features are superior, that once I realized I will  soon need to HEAR commands, rather than see them, I figured I'd better get on the horse now.Apple'sAccessibility Department has been  pretty patient with my telephoned questions.  And last week, I started  a 6-week free  class that the NJ Commission for the Blind and Visually-Impaired offers  at a local library on learning those very same accessibility  features.

She didn’t want the latest iPhone so we opted for a “premium renewed” phone.  I rolled my eyes as I wrote the quote.This was a regrettable, terrible decision.  There were many problems with the phone, but I will describe the two biggest issues.  First, the power button didn’t work correctly.  It became stuck in the pressed position after being pressed a few times.  This lead to a constant cycle of the phone restarting. Once the recycling stopped, she didn’t dare try to lock the phone.The second issue is the lens cover came off one of the lenses.  The phone wasn’t dropped or mishandled.  The cover just fell off and it will not stay in place.  Just imagine how much water could have made its way into the phone even if the lens cover had not fallen off.We are returning the phone and just paid a little more for a new phone that will give us peace of mind.  When we asked the amusement park about the phone my wife lost, they said we likely would not get it back.  I wonder if her lost phone will make its way to this process.We love Amazon, but we won’t do this again.

My only complaint is that the battery is not new. I received it with 91% maximum capacity battery health. You actually pay extra for that “premium” condition to receive one above 90%. . You are not told if the phone has any replacement parts or if it has been repaired. I think this should be transparent. I feel at ease because of the generous 1 year window to return or replace. I haven’t read the fine print but I believe outside of physical damage you caused to the phone, you can exchange or return it if any problems arise. I feel like the screen isn’t as responsive and precise to touch and that the speaker is very quiet. My boyfriend has commented to me that he cannot hear me as well when I am using speakerphone to call him since I got the new phone.As far as the model I don’t see a gigantic difference between one and the 11 model. The battery might last slightly longer and the camera has better zoom capabilities. I think that the max brightness of the screen is a little brighter. The price I paid is very comparable and competitive with the big sites that sell refurbished phones. Definitely cheaper than Apple of course but when you buy their refurbished phones you get a new battery and guarantee it has all Apple parts.

I'm pretty  happy with it  .Tes devic eitself  looks impeccable: no scratches or dings, but  the best part: its battery health reads 98%!  HOT DOG!  And another bonus is that Amazon gives a one-year warrantee e w/ its""premium""  refurbished phones.  (which makes me VERY happy since I paid less than a third of what Apple charges for a brand new phone)It came with a slow, slow charger, but I bought a fast brick-and-cable e for a modest price  from Amazon.  So no problem.I was able to get update the OS software as soon as I set it up. Mycarrier helped me with the setting up - which was easy because it came with an embedded 3sim card.  So, again, no problem.I'm still  trying to adjust from my old  android  o my  new  Apple O phone S; but at  86, I'm slower than some in learning.  However  it appears easier than I'd assumed -given I've been balking for years about my unwillingness to o  ""learn a new operating system"".  But so many people had told  me that Apple's Accessibility features are superior, that once I realized I will  soon need to HEAR commands, rather than see them, I figured I'd better get on the horse now.Apple'sAccessibility Department has been  pretty patient with my telephoned questions.  And last week, I started  a 6-week free  class that the NJ Commission for the Blind and Visually-Impaired offers  at a local library on learning those very same accessibility  features.  So it appears that with thsi refrubisheds iPhone 13 Pro, I'm golden!

She didn’t want the latest iPhone so we opted for a “premium renewed” phone.  I rolled my eyes as I wrote the quote.This was a regrettable, terrible decision.  There were many problems with the phone, but I will describe the two biggest issues.  First, the power button didn’t work correctly.  It became stuck in the pressed position after being pressed a few times.  This lead to a constant cycle of the phone restarting. Once the recycling stopped, she didn’t dare try to lock the phone.The second issue is the lens cover came off one of the lenses.  The phone wasn’t dropped or mishandled.  The cover just fell off and it will not stay in place.  Just imagine how much water could have made its way into the phone even if the lens cover had not fallen off.We are returning the phone and just paid a little more for a new phone that will give us peace of mind.  When we asked the amusement park about the phone my wife lost, they said we likely would not get it back.  I wonder if her lost phone will make its way to this process.We love Amazon, but we won’t do this again.

My only complaint is that the battery is not new. I received it with 91% maximum capacity battery health. You actually pay extra for that “premium” condition to receive one above 90%. . You are not told if the phone has any replacement parts or if it has been repaired. I think this should be transparent. I feel at ease because of the generous 1 year window to return or replace. I haven’t read the fine print but I believe outside of physical damage you caused to the phone, you can exchange or return it if any problems arise. I feel like the screen isn’t as responsive and precise to touch and that the speaker is very quiet. My boyfriend has commented to me that he cannot hear me as well when I am using speakerphone to call him since I got the new phone.As far as the model I don’t see a gigantic difference between one and the 11 model. The battery might last slightly longer and the camera has better zoom capabilities. I think that the max brightness of the screen is a little brighter. The price I paid is very comparable and competitive with the big sites that sell refurbished phones. Definitely cheaper than Apple of course but when you buy their refurbished phones you get a new battery and guarantee it has all Apple parts.

And another bonus is that Amazon gives a one-year warrantee e w/ its""premium""  refurbished phones.  (which makes me VERY happy since I paid less than a third of what Apple charges for a brand new phone)It came with a slow, slow charger, but I bought a fast brick-and-cable e for a modest price  from Amazon.  So no problem.I was able to get update the OS software as soon as I set it up. Mycarrier helped me with the setting up - which was easy because it came with an embedded 3sim card.  So, again, no problem.I'm still  trying to adjust from my old  android  o my  new  Apple O phone S; but at  86, I'm slower than some in learning.  However  it appears easier than I'd assumed -given I've been balking for years about my unwillingness to o  ""learn a new operating system"".  But so many people had told  me that Apple's Accessibility features are superior, that once I realized I will  soon need to HEAR commands, rather than see them, I figured I'd better get on the horse now.Apple'sAccessibility Department has been  pretty patient with my telephoned questions.  And last week, I started  a 6-week free  class that the NJ Commission for the Blind and Visually-Impaired offers  at a local library on learning those very same accessibility  features.  So it appears that with thsi refrubisheds iPhone 13 Pro, I'm golden!

She didn’t want the latest iPhone so we opted for a “premium renewed” phone.  I rolled my eyes as I wrote the quote.This was a regrettable, terrible decision.  There were many problems with the phone, but I will describe the two biggest issues.  First, the power button didn’t work correctly.  It became stuck in the pressed position after being pressed a few times.  This lead to a constant cycle of the phone restarting. Once the recycling stopped, she didn’t dare try to lock the phone.The second issue is the lens cover came off one of the lenses.  The phone wasn’t dropped or mishandled.  The cover just fell off and it will not stay in place.  Just imagine how much water could have made its way into the phone even if the lens cover had not fallen off.We are returning the phone and just paid a little more for a new phone that will give us peace of mind.  When we asked the amusement park about the phone my wife lost, they said we likely would not get it back.  I wonder if her lost phone will make its way to this process.We love Amazon, but we won’t do this again.

My only complaint is that the battery is not new. I received it with 91% maximum capacity battery health. You actually pay extra for that “premium” condition to receive one above 90%. . You are not told if the phone has any replacement parts or if it has been repaired. I think this should be transparent. I feel at ease because of the generous 1 year window to return or replace. I haven’t read the fine print but I believe outside of physical damage you caused to the phone, you can exchange or return it if any problems arise. I feel like the screen isn’t as responsive and precise to touch and that the speaker is very quiet. My boyfriend has commented to me that he cannot hear me as well when I am using speakerphone to call him since I got the new phone.As far as the model I don’t see a gigantic difference between one and the 11 model. The battery might last slightly longer and the camera has better zoom capabilities. I think that the max brightness of the screen is a little brighter. The price I paid is very comparable and competitive with the big sites that sell refurbished phones. Definitely cheaper than Apple of course but when you buy their refurbished phones you get a new battery and guarantee it has all Apple parts.

Pero me comuniqué directo a Amazon y me reembolsaron sin ningún problema. Me arriesgué a pedirlo nuevamente y esta vez llegó en el tiempo prometido.Viene en una cajita de Amazon renewed, el teléfono protegido con una mica provisional y cargador genérico nuevo. En teoría viene el ganchito removedor de SIM, pero no estaba en el paquete.En estética está casi perfecto, solo tiene una pequeña manchita en la parte trasera casi imperceptible, la pantalla sin rayones, no tiene golpes visibles.En cuanto a la batería me llegó con el 93%, y en dos semanas de uso bajó al 91%, no sé si le di un uso incorrecto, pero cuido de las recomendaciones y ya se ha mantenido así. Me hubiera encantado que llegara con mayor vida, pero igual está dentro del rango que promete la descripción.En cuanto a las cámaras por el momento todo OK, funcionan muy bien y la verdad si se siente el brinco a un iPhone Pro al ver la calidad de las imágenes.Seguiré probando y cualquier cosa extraña haré una actualización.

And another bonus is that Amazon gives a one-year warrantee e w/ its""premium""  refurbished phones.  (which makes me VERY happy since I paid less than a third of what Apple charges for a brand new phone)It came with a slow, slow charger, but I bought a fast brick-and-cable e for a modest price  from Amazon.  So no problem.I was able to get update the OS software as soon as I set it up. Mycarrier helped me with the setting up - which was easy because it came with an embedded 3sim card.  So, again, no problem.I'm still  trying to adjust from my old  android  o my  new  Apple O phone S; but at  86, I'm slower than some in learning.  However  it appears easier than I'd assumed -given I've been balking for years about my unwillingness to o  ""learn a new operating system"".  But so many people had told  me that Apple's Accessibility features are superior, that once I realized I will  soon need to HEAR commands, rather than see them, I figured I'd better get on the horse now.Apple'sAccessibility Department has been  pretty patient with my telephoned questions.  And last week, I started  a 6-week free  class that the NJ Commission for the Blind and Visually-Impaired offers  at a local library on learning those very same accessibility  features.  So it appears that with thsi refrubisheds iPhone 13 Pro, I'm golden!

The camera on this phone is great and a major upgrade from his previous phone.

She didn’t want the latest iPhone so we opted for a “premium renewed” phone.  I rolled my eyes as I wrote the quote.This was a regrettable, terrible decision.  There were many problems with the phone, but I will describe the two biggest issues.  First, the power button didn’t work correctly.  It became stuck in the pressed position after being pressed a few times.  This lead to a constant cycle of the phone restarting. Once the recycling stopped, she didn’t dare try to lock the phone.The second issue is the lens cover came off one of the lenses.  The phone wasn’t dropped or mishandled.  The cover just fell off and it will not stay in place.  Just imagine how much water could have made its way into the phone even if the lens cover had not fallen off.We are returning the phone and just paid a little more for a new phone that will give us peace of mind.  When we asked the amusement park about the phone my wife lost, they said we likely would not get it back.  I wonder if her lost phone will make its way to this process.We love Amazon, but we won’t do this again.

My only complaint is that the battery is not new. I received it with 91% maximum capacity battery health. You actually pay extra for that “premium” condition to receive one above 90%. . You are not told if the phone has any replacement parts or if it has been repaired. I think this should be transparent. I feel at ease because of the generous 1 year window to return or replace. I haven’t read the fine print but I believe outside of physical damage you caused to the phone, you can exchange or return it if any problems arise. I feel like the screen isn’t as responsive and precise to touch and that the speaker is very quiet. My boyfriend has commented to me that he cannot hear me as well when I am using speakerphone to call him since I got the new phone.As far as the model I don’t see a gigantic difference between one and the 11 model. The battery might last slightly longer and the camera has better zoom capabilities. I think that the max brightness of the screen is a little brighter. The price I paid is very comparable and competitive with the big sites that sell refurbished phones. Definitely cheaper than Apple of course but when you buy their refurbished phones you get a new battery and guarantee it has all Apple parts.

Pero me comuniqué directo a Amazon y me reembolsaron sin ningún problema. Me arriesgué a pedirlo nuevamente y esta vez llegó en el tiempo prometido.Viene en una cajita de Amazon renewed, el teléfono protegido con una mica provisional y cargador genérico nuevo. En teoría viene el ganchito removedor de SIM, pero no estaba en el paquete.En estética está casi perfecto, solo tiene una pequeña manchita en la parte trasera casi imperceptible, la pantalla sin rayones, no tiene golpes visibles.En cuanto a la batería me llegó con el 93%, y en dos semanas de uso bajó al 91%, no sé si le di un uso incorrecto, pero cuido de las recomendaciones y ya se ha mantenido así. Me hubiera encantado que llegara con mayor vida, pero igual está dentro del rango que promete la descripción.En cuanto a las cámaras por el momento todo OK, funcionan muy bien y la verdad si se siente el brinco a un iPhone Pro al ver la calidad de las imágenes.Seguiré probando y cualquier cosa extraña haré una actualización. Por el momento estoy muy contenta y si recomiendo mucho darle la oportunidad a este producto.

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.

It was 88. For it to be a good condition or acceptable condition that number will have been great, but at the end of the day, little disappointed with battery health.External aspect - Great, front seems brand new, on the back few minor scratches. Im a very detailed person, I think majority of people would not even notice those tiny scratches on the back.Internal - As I mentioned earlier, battery not great. Rest of it seems pretty good with just one day of use. At first, while setting it up it got a little warm, but was expected. Unlocked as expected.Overall good service from the seller, fast shipping, and excellent condition. Will buy again for sure. Battery wasn't as expected

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.

It was 88. For it to be a good condition or acceptable condition that number will have been great, but at the end of the day, little disappointed with battery health.External aspect - Great, front seems brand new, on the back few minor scratches. Im a very detailed person, I think majority of people would not even notice those tiny scratches on the back.Internal - As I mentioned earlier, battery not great. Rest of it seems pretty good with just one day of use. At first, while setting it up it got a little warm, but was expected. Unlocked as expected.Overall good service from the seller, fast shipping, and excellent condition. Will buy again for sure. Battery wasn't as expected

Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.

It was 88. For it to be a good condition or acceptable condition that number will have been great, but at the end of the day, little disappointed with battery health.External aspect - Great, front seems brand new, on the back few minor scratches. Im a very detailed person, I think majority of people would not even notice those tiny scratches on the back.Internal - As I mentioned earlier, battery not great. Rest of it seems pretty good with just one day of use. At first, while setting it up it got a little warm, but was expected. Unlocked as expected.Overall good service from the seller, fast shipping, and excellent condition. Will buy again for sure. Battery wasn't as expected

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.

It covers all the essentials while maintaining that classic Apple feel.If you’re looking for a reliable device that won’t empty your wallet, the iPhone SE 3rd generation is a fantastic choice. It’s proof that you can have quality without all the bells and whistles! Highly recommend! 📱✨

The only drawback is that the battery’s maximum capacity is 97%, which is obviously well above the promised 80%.  So far, so good.  At this rate, I would buy refurbished again and would buy again from this seller.

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service.Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that.The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone.Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it.The phone came 95% charged.

Im a very detailed person, I think majority of people would not even notice those tiny scratches on the back.Internal - As I mentioned earlier, battery not great.

Easy to buy, 2/3 the price, and high quality. I did not buy the premium renewal (no scratches and battery 90%+ health) but the standard which Amazon said wound be scratches you can’t see from arm’s length and battery health 80%+. The condition was near perfect. No noticeable scrapes at any distance. Looked good as new. Battery health 83%. The config was easy. I had my existing phone next to it and used the Apple method to copy everything phone to phone. Took 30 minutes but everything copied over including photos, messages, apps, settings, logins, Safari bookmarks, wallpaper, passwords, WIFI SSIDs/passwords, and even contact photos. Only logins I had to re-do were TFA and Authenticator, which is to be expected. I am using this new phone on my sailboat for WIFI only. Instead of spending $6000 for data displays on my mast I bought the iPhone 13 Pro Max for $450 plus a $50 bracket. It’s an unlocked iPhone (no carrier or SIM card) and by simply skipping the option to insert a SIM or use an eSIM, it configured and put me on WIFI automatically. All my apps and subscriptions work fine on the new phone plus old. Subscriptions are AppleID or user-login based not device based so you can reuse all your premium apps. AppStore also worked as well as getting iMessage on both phones now even without the cell services (since it’s data). So, very cost effective solution! I looked into doing this with my carrier (Verizon) but you had to activate a new line which I didn’t want to do. Plus their selection of used phones was not as good as Amazon and the new phones are much more expensive if you are not trading in. So this is a great Amazon service!

Easy to buy, 2/3 the price, and high quality. I did not buy the premium renewal (no scratches and battery 90%+ health) but the standard which Amazon said wound be scratches you can’t see from arm’s length and battery health 80%+. The condition was near perfect. No noticeable scrapes at any distance. Looked good as new. Battery health 83%. The config was easy. I had my existing phone next to it and used the Apple method to copy everything phone to phone. Took 30 minutes but everything copied over including photos, messages, apps, settings, logins, Safari bookmarks, wallpaper, passwords, WIFI SSIDs/passwords, and even contact photos. Only logins I had to re-do were TFA and Authenticator, which is to be expected. I am using this new phone on my sailboat for WIFI only. Instead of spending $6000 for data displays on my mast I bought the iPhone 13 Pro Max for $450 plus a $50 bracket. It’s an unlocked iPhone (no carrier or SIM card) and by simply skipping the option to insert a SIM or use an eSIM, it configured and put me on WIFI automatically. All my apps and subscriptions work fine on the new phone plus old. Subscriptions are AppleID or user-login based not device based so you can reuse all your premium apps. AppStore also worked as well as getting iMessage on both phones now even without the cell services (since it’s data). So, very cost effective solution! I looked into doing this with my carrier (Verizon) but you had to activate a new line which I didn’t want to do. Plus their selection of used phones was not as good as Amazon and the new phones are much more expensive if you are not trading in. So this is a great Amazon service!

Easy to buy, 2/3 the price, and high quality. I did not buy the premium renewal (no scratches and battery 90%+ health) but the standard which Amazon said wound be scratches you can’t see from arm’s length and battery health 80%+. The condition was near perfect. No noticeable scrapes at any distance. Looked good as new. Battery health 83%. The config was easy. I had my existing phone next to it and used the Apple method to copy everything phone to phone. Took 30 minutes but everything copied over including photos, messages, apps, settings, logins, Safari bookmarks, wallpaper, passwords, WIFI SSIDs/passwords, and even contact photos. Only logins I had to re-do were TFA and Authenticator, which is to be expected. I am using this new phone on my sailboat for WIFI only. Instead of spending $6000 for data displays on my mast I bought the iPhone 13 Pro Max for $450 plus a $50 bracket. It’s an unlocked iPhone (no carrier or SIM card) and by simply skipping the option to insert a SIM or use an eSIM, it configured and put me on WIFI automatically. All my apps and subscriptions work fine on the new phone plus old. Subscriptions are AppleID or user-login based not device based so you can reuse all your premium apps. AppStore also worked as well as getting iMessage on both phones now even without the cell services (since it’s data). So, very cost effective solution! I looked into doing this with my carrier (Verizon) but you had to activate a new line which I didn’t want to do. Plus their selection of used phones was not as good as Amazon and the new phones are much more expensive if you are not trading in. So this is a great Amazon service!

We reached out to Amazon customer service, the lady who helped initially suggested us to contact Woot. Woot provided NO help, ZERO. Amazon customer service won't help because it was sold by Woot. Woot said they can't help because it was bought on amazon. After a few times back and forth, Woot created a return label for the phone and said they will refund. So we sent the phone back, UPS tracking info shows the phone arrived on 6/24. Today is 8/6, still no refund. Woot won't respond anymore. I emailed and called. Woot just says they can't help. I have mentioned that Woot created the return label and we followed the instruction and returned the phone. They just say there's nothing they can help now. Woot says Amazon needs to refund. Amazon says the return label was created by Woot so they don't know where the phone is. One of the customer service person at Amazon then created another return label even tho we have explained that phone has been returned. Sooo much money and time wasted on this. We have returned the phone that doesn't work, and still no refund.Just DO NOT buy anything from Woot.

Easy to buy, 2/3 the price, and high quality. I did not buy the premium renewal (no scratches and battery 90%+ health) but the standard which Amazon said wound be scratches you can’t see from arm’s length and battery health 80%+. The condition was near perfect. No noticeable scrapes at any distance. Looked good as new. Battery health 83%. The config was easy. I had my existing phone next to it and used the Apple method to copy everything phone to phone. Took 30 minutes but everything copied over including photos, messages, apps, settings, logins, Safari bookmarks, wallpaper, passwords, WIFI SSIDs/passwords, and even contact photos. Only logins I had to re-do were TFA and Authenticator, which is to be expected. I am using this new phone on my sailboat for WIFI only. Instead of spending $6000 for data displays on my mast I bought the iPhone 13 Pro Max for $450 plus a $50 bracket. It’s an unlocked iPhone (no carrier or SIM card) and by simply skipping the option to insert a SIM or use an eSIM, it configured and put me on WIFI automatically. All my apps and subscriptions work fine on the new phone plus old. Subscriptions are AppleID or user-login based not device based so you can reuse all your premium apps. AppStore also worked as well as getting iMessage on both phones now even without the cell services (since it’s data). So, very cost effective solution! I looked into doing this with my carrier (Verizon) but you had to activate a new line which I didn’t want to do. Plus their selection of used phones was not as good as Amazon and the new phones are much more expensive if you are not trading in. So this is a great Amazon service!

We reached out to Amazon customer service, the lady who helped initially suggested us to contact Woot. Woot provided NO help, ZERO. Amazon customer service won't help because it was sold by Woot. Woot said they can't help because it was bought on amazon. After a few times back and forth, Woot created a return label for the phone and said they will refund. So we sent the phone back, UPS tracking info shows the phone arrived on 6/24. Today is 8/6, still no refund. Woot won't respond anymore. I emailed and called. Woot just says they can't help. I have mentioned that Woot created the return label and we followed the instruction and returned the phone. They just say there's nothing they can help now. Woot says Amazon needs to refund. Amazon says the return label was created by Woot so they don't know where the phone is. One of the customer service person at Amazon then created another return label even tho we have explained that phone has been returned. Sooo much money and time wasted on this. We have returned the phone that doesn't work, and still no refund.Just DO NOT buy anything from Woot.

 Please read full review if you are nervous from reading negative reviews….Phew! Boy was I nervous after reading negative reviews. Turns out I either got lucky or those people used the charger that came with the box😅🤣… anyway my point is this is an incredible phone. This phone came with 32 gigabytes of storage instead of the 16gigs mentioned in the description, fingerprint recognition, working camera, zero scratches or signs of use, perfect brightness and battery, I’ve charged the phone one time (not fully) and it’s lasted me 2 hours so far. Charged it to 50% two hours ago and now it’s at 23%.I have been able to use every app I have downloaded on my iPhone 12 Pro Max on this little phone. It’s a trooper for sure. The phone has not gotten hot once after using it nonstop 2 hours after package received. Do not use the cord and charger box that came with this phone as it is not original apple which will ruin your battery life, use an apple cord that you can purchase at your local Walmart or Best Buy.Another thing, phone came fully unlocked as stated in description. I’ve also downloaded a free app called text now to make calls and it works great. I will say this is a great purchase and I mean it.

It has some minor scratches and a small ding on the bottom right hand corner but it is not too noticeable since I put it in the case. I bought the 16 GB because I don't use the phone that much, but since I just switched from a Samsung I had to learn a lot of the features since this is my first Apple and I was using it a lot more and had to keep plugging it in. I like it a lot better than my Samsung which is only a year old. I was unable to get any help from Consumer Cellular and they made an appointment for me at Target at11 am the next morning and when we got there we were told the person would not be in and there were no other Targets nearby which could help us. I love the small size but it is harder to hit the right keys since it is so small. I bought this phone because I did not want to spend $400 for a new SE since I did not know if I would like it. I am liking it more and more and do not want to go back to my Samsung. If you use the phone a lot I would recommend 32GB or 64GB.  Also if you have big hands you need to get a bigger phone.

The battery life says 87% but it only lasts 1 hr after being fully charged, it gets extremely hot while using plus the charger and USB were not compatible. I think amazon/merchandisers should review these phones and pull them from their selves.

I have to assume the ""Azumi"" is just a mistake. Both phones are great, good battery life. Hold a charge for a month when turned off. They are the same size as all the iphones I have had and take up to IOS 15.7.2 which is the last IOS they will take. This phone is compatible with LTE, GSM and CDMA so it should work with all carriers. The only downside is the 16 GB of memory. I use mine as a phone, so don't need a lot of apps, music or photos so no problem with the 16 GB. All in all a great value in an iphone.

My son liked it so I decided to keep it but I need to be compensated for the charger and USB or even a new battery......................Sometimes being cheap cost you more money...

This phone is compatible with LTE, GSM and CDMA so it should work with all carriers. The only downside is the 16 GB of memory.

 Please read full review if you are nervous from reading negative reviews….Phew! Boy was I nervous after reading negative reviews. Turns out I either got lucky or those people used the charger that came with the box😅🤣… anyway my point is this is an incredible phone. This phone came with 32 gigabytes of storage instead of the 16gigs mentioned in the description, fingerprint recognition, working camera, zero scratches or signs of use, perfect brightness and battery, I’ve charged the phone one time (not fully) and it’s lasted me 2 hours so far. Charged it to 50% two hours ago and now it’s at 23%.I have been able to use every app I have downloaded on my iPhone 12 Pro Max on this little phone. It’s a trooper for sure. The phone has not gotten hot once after using it nonstop 2 hours after package received. Do not use the cord and charger box that came with this phone as it is not original apple which will ruin your battery life, use an apple cord that you can purchase at your local Walmart or Best Buy.Another thing, phone came fully unlocked as stated in description. I’ve also downloaded a free app called text now to make calls and it works great. I will say this is a great purchase and I mean it.

It has some minor scratches and a small ding on the bottom right hand corner but it is not too noticeable since I put it in the case. I bought the 16 GB because I don't use the phone that much, but since I just switched from a Samsung I had to learn a lot of the features since this is my first Apple and I was using it a lot more and had to keep plugging it in. I like it a lot better than my Samsung which is only a year old. I was unable to get any help from Consumer Cellular and they made an appointment for me at Target at11 am the next morning and when we got there we were told the person would not be in and there were no other Targets nearby which could help us. I love the small size but it is harder to hit the right keys since it is so small. I bought this phone because I did not want to spend $400 for a new SE since I did not know if I would like it. I am liking it more and more and do not want to go back to my Samsung. If you use the phone a lot I would recommend 32GB or 64GB.  Also if you have big hands you need to get a bigger phone.

It has some minor scratches and a small ding on the bottom right hand corner but it is not too noticeable since I put it in the case. I bought the 16 GB because I don't use the phone that much, but since I just switched from a Samsung I had to learn a lot of the features since this is my first Apple and I was using it a lot more and had to keep plugging it in. I like it a lot better than my Samsung which is only a year old. I was unable to get any help from Consumer Cellular and they made an appointment for me at Target at11 am the next morning and when we got there we were told the person would not be in and there were no other Targets nearby which could help us. I love the small size but it is harder to hit the right keys since it is so small. I bought this phone because I did not want to spend $400 for a new SE since I did not know if I would like it. I am liking it more and more and do not want to go back to my Samsung. If you use the phone a lot I would recommend 32GB or 64GB.  Also if you have big hands you need to get a bigger phone.

The battery life says 87% but it only lasts 1 hr after being fully charged, it gets extremely hot while using plus the charger and USB were not compatible. I think amazon/merchandisers should review these phones and pull them from their selves. My son liked it so I decided to keep it but I need to be compensated for the charger and USB or even a new battery......................Sometimes being cheap cost you more money...

I have to assume the ""Azumi"" is just a mistake. Both phones are great, good battery life. Hold a charge for a month when turned off. They are the same size as all the iphones I have had and take up to IOS 15.7.2 which is the last IOS they will take. This phone is compatible with LTE, GSM and CDMA so it should work with all carriers. The only downside is the 16 GB of memory. I use mine as a phone, so don't need a lot of apps, music or photos so no problem with the 16 GB. All in all a great value in an iphone.

Also, Apple has removed the physical SIM slot for IPhone 14 for US customers.Transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iPhone to iPhone 14 wasn’t difficult.  It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.

Also, Apple has removed the physical SIM slot for IPhone 14 for US customers.Transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iPhone to iPhone 14 wasn’t difficult.  It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.

Also, Apple has removed the physical SIM slot for IPhone 14 for US customers.Transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iPhone to iPhone 14 wasn’t difficult.  It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

The phone itself is in amazing condition, works great and is infact unlocked.Product Condition 🔥-This iPhone had NO scratches NO dents and came prepackaged in amazons official renewal packaging. The phone itself was even wrapped in a plastic film to protect it.-The touch screen works great and has no scratches.- The camera has no scratches and the picture quality is 10/10.-My speaker works great and is loud 📢 compared to my previous phone.-The phone even came with a charger.Cons-The phone did not come charged so I had to charge it when it arrived.-The product was not up to date so I had to play around with set up

The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.

It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.

Also, Apple has removed the physical SIM slot for IPhone 14 for US customers.Transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iPhone to iPhone 14 wasn’t difficult.  It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

The phone itself is in amazing condition, works great and is infact unlocked.Product Condition 🔥-This iPhone had NO scratches NO dents and came prepackaged in amazons official renewal packaging.

The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.

It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.

I’m not the average person that keeps upgrading year after year. I waited a good amount of time before I decided on this decision. And I love Amazon, and when they said that they have a “Renewed Premium” iPhone for sale…they mean it. Apple does not sell Pro variant predecessor models (14 Pro/Pro Max, 13 Pro/Pro Max, etc) but only the newest which are the 15 Plus, Pro/Pro max ) so i had to look online and I found Amazon to have the best deal. I unboxed my iPhone 14 Pro and I couldn’t believe my eyes as to how flawless the phone was. It had zero and i mean ZERO scratches!!!The screen looked good, camera, battery, sound,  and the back finish had zero smudges or scratches. For the price, I am absolutely satisfied. I usually bide my time and wait years to pay for a brand new phone but Apple is asking for essentially a price of a mortgage payment for a new phone…it’s unrealistic. Buying refurbished not only saved me money but it’s better for the environment and Amazon does guarantee a 1 year return which is very gracious and I appreciate that, especially when you’re spending almost $1000 on a phone. The packaging was great and came with a USB cable and wall plug. I’m writing this review because i implore others to try out this opportunity because it’s good for your wallet and the environment. This changed the landscape of my cell phone shopping experience because i no longer have to pay full price for an iPhone from Apple. Apple does have a refurbished/clearance section on their website BUT the availability of their models/sizes/colors is scarce and the prices are still hiked up. I do believe Amazon “Renewed Premium” is the key to ensuring that you will get a high quality phone in good condition.The one thing that i found to be dubious of the shopping experience was that within the packaging, there was a card inside of a paper sleeve that had a bunch of checkboxes for the “technician” to check off all of the functions of the phone that were tested/passed and some of the checkboxes were titled “Touchbar” and “Trackpad”…and they were indeed checked on the checklist. But why? This is not a laptop or macbook and there is no “trackpad” or “touchbar” which leads me to challenge the integrity for the “testing” or “refurbishment” procedures at Amazon. Are they just checking all of the boxes to make it look presentably reliable or are they actually testing the functions of the phone? That’s something to consider. I did, however, test it myself and came to conclude that the phone was all good. Would I trust this process and buy another phone from Amazon, absolutely ! I just wanted to point that out.

Cosmetically flawless. Not one single scratch, nick or ding anywhere to be found. Phone arrived with original Apple plastic on screen and back in an Amazon Renewed box. Battery capacity at 95%. The testing checklist card that was included is dated Dec. 2023 so apparently the phone has been in a warehouse for 6 months. Not surprised or disappointed that it didn’t start at 100 %. I’ve seen the reviews that mention distorted speaker sound, dead spots on touch screen, scratches etc. Most of these “bad” phones are purchased from third party sellers. It’s very, very important to buy as SHIPPED FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon. If there’s any problems, you get a 1 year replacement/refund guarantee from Amazon. Third party sellers only offer a 30-60 day policy and it may take several weeks to process your return. Not worth the hassle. Another suggestion:  spend a few more bucks and go with Premium Renewed, you won’t be disappointed!  This iPhone 14 Pro has a super fast processor, beautiful vivid colors on the screen, holds a charge all day and has great video and still image capabilities. 5 stars all day!

It is beautiful and didn’t have a scratch on it. It looked brand new. The packaging was very nice and the charging cable and adapter was included. I was very happy with it. However, immediately after turning on the phone, the screen went black and would not come back on, so I had to return it.Amazon said they offered free returns. What they didn’t tell me was that in order for me to return it and get my $835.42 back I’d have to either stay home from work or have someone come to my house because I wasn’t permitted to take and drop the phone off at a UPS location. They had to send someone to pick it up from my house. So, I missed an entire day of work which cost me almost $400.00 and the UPS driver never showed up. I called UPD only to find out 1, that Amazon hadn’t notified them of the pickup and 2, the Return Authorization Slip that Amazon emailed me that was supposed to ensure the returned product was credited back to my credit card in case the mailing label had gotten damaged was invalid. So, apparently, if someone would have picked up the phone and damaged the mailing label I would not have had my money refunded.I called Amazon back to tell them what UPS told me. Amazon’s solution was to start the return process all over again. Meaning that I would have to miss another day of work in order to wait for UPS to pick up the phone. I told them that was absolutely unacceptable.

I’m not the average person that keeps upgrading year after year. I waited a good amount of time before I decided on this decision. And I love Amazon, and when they said that they have a “Renewed Premium” iPhone for sale…they mean it. Apple does not sell Pro variant predecessor models (14 Pro/Pro Max, 13 Pro/Pro Max, etc) but only the newest which are the 15 Plus, Pro/Pro max ) so i had to look online and I found Amazon to have the best deal. I unboxed my iPhone 14 Pro and I couldn’t believe my eyes as to how flawless the phone was. It had zero and i mean ZERO scratches!!!The screen looked good, camera, battery, sound,  and the back finish had zero smudges or scratches. For the price, I am absolutely satisfied. I usually bide my time and wait years to pay for a brand new phone but Apple is asking for essentially a price of a mortgage payment for a new phone…it’s unrealistic. Buying refurbished not only saved me money but it’s better for the environment and Amazon does guarantee a 1 year return which is very gracious and I appreciate that, especially when you’re spending almost $1000 on a phone. The packaging was great and came with a USB cable and wall plug. I’m writing this review because i implore others to try out this opportunity because it’s good for your wallet and the environment. This changed the landscape of my cell phone shopping experience because i no longer have to pay full price for an iPhone from Apple. Apple does have a refurbished/clearance section on their website BUT the availability of their models/sizes/colors is scarce and the prices are still hiked up. I do believe Amazon “Renewed Premium” is the key to ensuring that you will get a high quality phone in good condition.The one thing that i found to be dubious of the shopping experience was that within the packaging, there was a card inside of a paper sleeve that had a bunch of checkboxes for the “technician” to check off all of the functions of the phone that were tested/passed and some of the checkboxes were titled “Touchbar” and “Trackpad”…and they were indeed checked on the checklist. But why? This is not a laptop or macbook and there is no “trackpad” or “touchbar” which leads me to challenge the integrity for the “testing” or “refurbishment” procedures at Amazon. Are they just checking all of the boxes to make it look presentably reliable or are they actually testing the functions of the phone? That’s something to consider. I did, however, test it myself and came to conclude that the phone was all good. Would I trust this process and buy another phone from Amazon, absolutely ! I just wanted to point that out.

Cosmetically flawless. Not one single scratch, nick or ding anywhere to be found. Phone arrived with original Apple plastic on screen and back in an Amazon Renewed box. Battery capacity at 95%. The testing checklist card that was included is dated Dec. 2023 so apparently the phone has been in a warehouse for 6 months. Not surprised or disappointed that it didn’t start at 100 %. I’ve seen the reviews that mention distorted speaker sound, dead spots on touch screen, scratches etc. Most of these “bad” phones are purchased from third party sellers. It’s very, very important to buy as SHIPPED FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon. If there’s any problems, you get a 1 year replacement/refund guarantee from Amazon. Third party sellers only offer a 30-60 day policy and it may take several weeks to process your return. Not worth the hassle. Another suggestion:  spend a few more bucks and go with Premium Renewed, you won’t be disappointed!  This iPhone 14 Pro has a super fast processor, beautiful vivid colors on the screen, holds a charge all day and has great video and still image capabilities. 5 stars all day!

It is beautiful and didn’t have a scratch on it. It looked brand new. The packaging was very nice and the charging cable and adapter was included. I was very happy with it. However, immediately after turning on the phone, the screen went black and would not come back on, so I had to return it.Amazon said they offered free returns. What they didn’t tell me was that in order for me to return it and get my $835.42 back I’d have to either stay home from work or have someone come to my house because I wasn’t permitted to take and drop the phone off at a UPS location. They had to send someone to pick it up from my house. So, I missed an entire day of work which cost me almost $400.00 and the UPS driver never showed up. I called UPD only to find out 1, that Amazon hadn’t notified them of the pickup and 2, the Return Authorization Slip that Amazon emailed me that was supposed to ensure the returned product was credited back to my credit card in case the mailing label had gotten damaged was invalid. So, apparently, if someone would have picked up the phone and damaged the mailing label I would not have had my money refunded.I called Amazon back to tell them what UPS told me. Amazon’s solution was to start the return process all over again. Meaning that I would have to miss another day of work in order to wait for UPS to pick up the phone. I told them that was absolutely unacceptable. The customer service rep was adamant that that was my only option and it wasn’t until I got angry and insisted they email me a return label, so I could drop it off at a UPS store that they finally agreed to do so.I printed off the label and repackaged the box with the new Return Authorization Slip (I hope it’s valid this time) and dropped it off at UPS.I HOPE my money is refunded without issue even though they told me it could take up to 40 DAYS to do so.

I’m not the average person that keeps upgrading year after year. I waited a good amount of time before I decided on this decision. And I love Amazon, and when they said that they have a “Renewed Premium” iPhone for sale…they mean it. Apple does not sell Pro variant predecessor models (14 Pro/Pro Max, 13 Pro/Pro Max, etc) but only the newest which are the 15 Plus, Pro/Pro max ) so i had to look online and I found Amazon to have the best deal.

But why? This is not a laptop or macbook and there is no “trackpad” or “touchbar” which leads me to challenge the integrity for the “testing” or “refurbishment” procedures at Amazon. Are they just checking all of the boxes to make it look presentably reliable or are they actually testing the functions of the phone? That’s something to consider. I did, however, test it myself and came to conclude that the phone was all good. Would I trust this process and buy another phone from Amazon, absolutely ! I just wanted to point that out.

Cosmetically flawless. Not one single scratch, nick or ding anywhere to be found. Phone arrived with original Apple plastic on screen and back in an Amazon Renewed box. Battery capacity at 95%. The testing checklist card that was included is dated Dec. 2023 so apparently the phone has been in a warehouse for 6 months. Not surprised or disappointed that it didn’t start at 100 %. I’ve seen the reviews that mention distorted speaker sound, dead spots on touch screen, scratches etc. Most of these “bad” phones are purchased from third party sellers. It’s very, very important to buy as SHIPPED FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon. If there’s any problems, you get a 1 year replacement/refund guarantee from Amazon. Third party sellers only offer a 30-60 day policy and it may take several weeks to process your return. Not worth the hassle. Another suggestion:  spend a few more bucks and go with Premium Renewed, you won’t be disappointed!  This iPhone 14 Pro has a super fast processor, beautiful vivid colors on the screen, holds a charge all day and has great video and still image capabilities. 5 stars all day!

It is beautiful and didn’t have a scratch on it. It looked brand new. The packaging was very nice and the charging cable and adapter was included. I was very happy with it. However, immediately after turning on the phone, the screen went black and would not come back on, so I had to return it.Amazon said they offered free returns. What they didn’t tell me was that in order for me to return it and get my $835.42 back I’d have to either stay home from work or have someone come to my house because I wasn’t permitted to take and drop the phone off at a UPS location. They had to send someone to pick it up from my house. So, I missed an entire day of work which cost me almost $400.00 and the UPS driver never showed up. I called UPD only to find out 1, that Amazon hadn’t notified them of the pickup and 2, the Return Authorization Slip that Amazon emailed me that was supposed to ensure the returned product was credited back to my credit card in case the mailing label had gotten damaged was invalid. So, apparently, if someone would have picked up the phone and damaged the mailing label I would not have had my money refunded.I called Amazon back to tell them what UPS told me. Amazon’s solution was to start the return process all over again. Meaning that I would have to miss another day of work in order to wait for UPS to pick up the phone. I told them that was absolutely unacceptable. The customer service rep was adamant that that was my only option and it wasn’t until I got angry and insisted they email me a return label, so I could drop it off at a UPS store that they finally agreed to do so.I printed off the label and repackaged the box with the new Return Authorization Slip (I hope it’s valid this time) and dropped it off at UPS.I HOPE my money is refunded without issue even though they told me it could take up to 40 DAYS to do so.

But why? This is not a laptop or macbook and there is no “trackpad” or “touchbar” which leads me to challenge the integrity for the “testing” or “refurbishment” procedures at Amazon. Are they just checking all of the boxes to make it look presentably reliable or are they actually testing the functions of the phone? That’s something to consider. I did, however, test it myself and came to conclude that the phone was all good. Would I trust this process and buy another phone from Amazon, absolutely ! I just wanted to point that out.

Cosmetically flawless. Not one single scratch, nick or ding anywhere to be found. Phone arrived with original Apple plastic on screen and back in an Amazon Renewed box. Battery capacity at 95%. The testing checklist card that was included is dated Dec. 2023 so apparently the phone has been in a warehouse for 6 months. Not surprised or disappointed that it didn’t start at 100 %. I’ve seen the reviews that mention distorted speaker sound, dead spots on touch screen, scratches etc. Most of these “bad” phones are purchased from third party sellers. It’s very, very important to buy as SHIPPED FROM AND SOLD BY Amazon. If there’s any problems, you get a 1 year replacement/refund guarantee from Amazon. Third party sellers only offer a 30-60 day policy and it may take several weeks to process your return. Not worth the hassle. Another suggestion:  spend a few more bucks and go with Premium Renewed, you won’t be disappointed!  This iPhone 14 Pro has a super fast processor, beautiful vivid colors on the screen, holds a charge all day and has great video and still image capabilities. 5 stars all day!

It is beautiful and didn’t have a scratch on it. It looked brand new. The packaging was very nice and the charging cable and adapter was included. I was very happy with it. However, immediately after turning on the phone, the screen went black and would not come back on, so I had to return it.Amazon said they offered free returns. What they didn’t tell me was that in order for me to return it and get my $835.42 back I’d have to either stay home from work or have someone come to my house because I wasn’t permitted to take and drop the phone off at a UPS location. They had to send someone to pick it up from my house. So, I missed an entire day of work which cost me almost $400.00 and the UPS driver never showed up. I called UPD only to find out 1, that Amazon hadn’t notified them of the pickup and 2, the Return Authorization Slip that Amazon emailed me that was supposed to ensure the returned product was credited back to my credit card in case the mailing label had gotten damaged was invalid. So, apparently, if someone would have picked up the phone and damaged the mailing label I would not have had my money refunded.I called Amazon back to tell them what UPS told me. Amazon’s solution was to start the return process all over again. Meaning that I would have to miss another day of work in order to wait for UPS to pick up the phone. I told them that was absolutely unacceptable. The customer service rep was adamant that that was my only option and it wasn’t until I got angry and insisted they email me a return label, so I could drop it off at a UPS store that they finally agreed to do so.I printed off the label and repackaged the box with the new Return Authorization Slip (I hope it’s valid this time) and dropped it off at UPS.I HOPE my money is refunded without issue even though they told me it could take up to 40 DAYS to do so.

Battery health at 89%. No scratches. No cracks on the screen or the back of the phone. The cameras at the back are clear and no scratches either. Front camera is great too. It was also unlocked too. The only weird thing is that I shook my phone and then it said no sim detected. But then like a minute later it read the sim and was good to go again. It does get a little hot when you charge it and try to use it (but I honestly think that’s really just an iPhone thing all together). Plus where I live is really hot, so that could be a reason too. I do think for the quality I got, it was definitely worth the price. No pictures because I don’t have an extra phone to take pics of the phone.

This phone not supporting any SIM card because network IC ( Network chip) gets bad. I reached out to the seller and they suggested to took it to local repair center. I took it in the local repair center but they’re asking 520$ to fixing it but also not guaranteed it’ll work back on or support any SIM card again. Now I’m afraid to spend 520$ again to fixing it without guarantee that it’ll won’t be go bad again. Do not buy this phone and spend 990$ dollars. It’s not worth it trust me. I learned my lesson to trusting renewal programs. I’m totally disappointed and not recommended to anyone get this specific product. Do not trust their false description about this phone.

I believe it and spend 990$ dollars and didn’t get to use phone more then 6 months. Very very very disappointed. NOT RECOMMENDED ***

Never going to buy from woot.com, bad experience, scratch and dent is scratched up screen pretty bad even there is line that might be cracked, but i can't tell since they got screen protector on, the looks like who had it before just rubbed it on the ground.battery capacity was 84 %  even though the phone is iphone11 pro. Getting return authorization is a nightmare, still working on getting one, i sent them and email no response for two days, click to get a call from customer serivce but providing my number does not work always they say call ended becuase they claim i did not answer even they they did not call. I got an old school email in the account that i cant access i want change, they wont change it unless i remember the password for woot, even though i logged in with amazon account, i dont think i have a woot account on its own to begin with. If i dont get this thing resolved this week i will call my credit card to dispute the charges, amazon should just take over the whole system on woot.com not just have owned without managing their cutomer service

I bought three 6S Plus models from roughly 2015-2022, when I switched over to this XS Max in February of 2022.Battery life: Goes all day, maybe even a couple days depending on my usage (averaging between 5-8 hours/day). I actually got it because my 6S Plus wasn't lasting all day anymore.Cons: The first one I got, there was an issue with the speaker, so I sent it back. The new one (that I have now) has an issue with the other speaker, that you listen to when holding to your ear. I decided that was a minor issue since I use bluetooth earbuds and speakerphone a lot, and hold the phone to my ear very little (now I do it never, since it's not an option). The other thing I don't like is that I can't use wired headphones (without purchasing extra dongle equipment), 6S Plus was the last model to offer that. Unfortunately, these ""Renewed"" models often come with some issue or other; the trick is to decide if it's something you can live with for the savings.Pros: Love the 512 GB upgrade from my previous 256 GB. This is my new standard. I have a decent amount of my curated music, and plenty of space to DL from Spotify.

There was maybe like 1 tiny scratch on the back, akin to a micro abrasion. Nothing of concern.I also got an iPhone x and a Samsung Galaxy S10 in a similarity perfect condition.Yes, sometimes the prices can be a little higher compared to other sellers, but the quality you get is guaranteed for your money.I work in tech repairs so I know how to test all the functions of the phone, and again, everything was perfect. It was Unlocked, face id works, cameras, speakers and battery were all good.Will definitely order from them again in the future.

When the display is on you can not see anything but the beautiful OLED screen.  The battery health was a wonderful surprise too amazon standard is better than 80% mine came in at 100% so it is my thought they put a new battery in and that is awesome.  I have had time to set it up with a service and it came unlocked as promised as well.  The call quality is great and all the app i use work incredible faster than my last iphone 6S plus.  Don't get me wrong my old iphone still works great but this one just blows it away.

Never going to buy from woot.com, bad experience, scratch and dent is scratched up screen pretty bad even there is line that might be cracked, but i can't tell since they got screen protector on, the looks like who had it before just rubbed it on the ground.battery capacity was 84 %  even though the phone is iphone11 pro. Getting return authorization is a nightmare, still working on getting one, i sent them and email no response for two days, click to get a call from customer serivce but providing my number does not work always they say call ended becuase they claim i did not answer even they they did not call. I got an old school email in the account that i cant access i want change, they wont change it unless i remember the password for woot, even though i logged in with amazon account, i dont think i have a woot account on its own to begin with. If i dont get this thing resolved this week i will call my credit card to dispute the charges, amazon should just take over the whole system on woot.com not just have owned without managing their cutomer service

I bought three 6S Plus models from roughly 2015-2022, when I switched over to this XS Max in February of 2022.Battery life: Goes all day, maybe even a couple days depending on my usage (averaging between 5-8 hours/day). I actually got it because my 6S Plus wasn't lasting all day anymore.Cons: The first one I got, there was an issue with the speaker, so I sent it back. The new one (that I have now) has an issue with the other speaker, that you listen to when holding to your ear. I decided that was a minor issue since I use bluetooth earbuds and speakerphone a lot, and hold the phone to my ear very little (now I do it never, since it's not an option). The other thing I don't like is that I can't use wired headphones (without purchasing extra dongle equipment), 6S Plus was the last model to offer that. Unfortunately, these ""Renewed"" models often come with some issue or other; the trick is to decide if it's something you can live with for the savings.Pros: Love the 512 GB upgrade from my previous 256 GB. This is my new standard. I have a decent amount of my curated music, and plenty of space to DL from Spotify.

There was maybe like 1 tiny scratch on the back, akin to a micro abrasion. Nothing of concern.I also got an iPhone x and a Samsung Galaxy S10 in a similarity perfect condition.Yes, sometimes the prices can be a little higher compared to other sellers, but the quality you get is guaranteed for your money.I work in tech repairs so I know how to test all the functions of the phone, and again, everything was perfect. It was Unlocked, face id works, cameras, speakers and battery were all good.Will definitely order from them again in the future.

Much to my surprise it exceeded my expectation,  The Iphone arrived in very good condition there were a few light scratches on the screen that you had to hold just right to the light to even see them.  When the display is on you can not see anything but the beautiful OLED screen.  The battery health was a wonderful surprise too amazon standard is better than 80% mine came in at 100% so it is my thought they put a new battery in and that is awesome.  I have had time to set it up with a service and it came unlocked as promised as well.  The call quality is great and all the app i use work incredible faster than my last iphone 6S plus.  Don't get me wrong my old iphone still works great but this one just blows it away.  I would have no problem recommending Synergy to my friends and family to buy with confidence. 620.00 was a great deal for the Iphone XS max with 512gb and it arrived in even better shape than I had hopped for.

There was maybe like 1 tiny scratch on the back, akin to a micro abrasion. Nothing of concern.I also got an iPhone x and a Samsung Galaxy S10 in a similarity perfect condition.Yes, sometimes the prices can be a little higher compared to other sellers, but the quality you get is guaranteed for your money.I work in tech repairs so I know how to test all the functions of the phone, and again, everything was perfect. It was Unlocked, face id works, cameras, speakers and battery were all good.Will definitely order from them again in the future.

Much to my surprise it exceeded my expectation,  The Iphone arrived in very good condition there were a few light scratches on the screen that you had to hold just right to the light to even see them.  When the display is on you can not see anything but the beautiful OLED screen.  The battery health was a wonderful surprise too amazon standard is better than 80% mine came in at 100% so it is my thought they put a new battery in and that is awesome.  I have had time to set it up with a service and it came unlocked as promised as well.  The call quality is great and all the app i use work incredible faster than my last iphone 6S plus.  Don't get me wrong my old iphone still works great but this one just blows it away.  I would have no problem recommending Synergy to my friends and family to buy with confidence. 620.00 was a great deal for the Iphone XS max with 512gb and it arrived in even better shape than I had hopped for.

Amazon will refund my money, but only after I take another hour to get it wrapped up and shipped back (and wait several days).Perhaps ""unlocked"" isn't really one of their 65 special inspection items?

There was maybe like 1 tiny scratch on the back, akin to a micro abrasion. Nothing of concern.I also got an iPhone x and a Samsung Galaxy S10 in a similarity perfect condition.Yes, sometimes the prices can be a little higher compared to other sellers, but the quality you get is guaranteed for your money.I work in tech repairs so I know how to test all the functions of the phone, and again, everything was perfect. It was Unlocked, face id works, cameras, speakers and battery were all good.Will definitely order from them again in the future.

Much to my surprise it exceeded my expectation,  The Iphone arrived in very good condition there were a few light scratches on the screen that you had to hold just right to the light to even see them.  When the display is on you can not see anything but the beautiful OLED screen.  The battery health was a wonderful surprise too amazon standard is better than 80% mine came in at 100% so it is my thought they put a new battery in and that is awesome.  I have had time to set it up with a service and it came unlocked as promised as well.  The call quality is great and all the app i use work incredible faster than my last iphone 6S plus.  Don't get me wrong my old iphone still works great but this one just blows it away.  I would have no problem recommending Synergy to my friends and family to buy with confidence. 620.00 was a great deal for the Iphone XS max with 512gb and it arrived in even better shape than I had hopped for.

Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.

If Amazon is putting their stamp of approval on these types of items, I as the consumer am trusting this company to make sure what I am getting is up to par with the standards I hold this company that I've been using for years. iPhones are not the cheapest phones by a landslide so I expect these bricks to work well even if they are partially used.

Worked like a charm. The only set back was having to catch up the phone on all of the updates but that was resolved and the set up was overall easy to do and manageable. I would definitely buy an Amazon Renewed product in the future. If Amazon is putting their stamp of approval on these types of items, I as the consumer am trusting this company to make sure what I am getting is up to par with the standards I hold this company that I've been using for years. iPhones are not the cheapest phones by a landslide so I expect these bricks to work well even if they are partially used. Great condition overall without any scratches almost new if anything else and arrived in packaging protecting the device.

The only ""complaint"" i would have is that the iPhone's software can tell when the display is not Apple authorized, however it hasn't affected its performance at all.

The iPhone 15 has several quirks that I didn't expect, but after I figured them out with the help of Apple staff and Google, I like the phone very much.  It was the first time I've bought a refurbished phone, but it is worth the price difference.  Note: The cable included with the iPhone doesn't include the adapter (the blocky thing you plug into an outlet), so plan on buying one separately.  Amazon sells both adapters and cable cords and you'll need them, so you might as well add them when you buy the iPhone.

I was worried that I would get a beat up phone that is still functional but surprisingly it was about fine, like 9.5/10 fine, all there was that showed it was renewed was a slight scratch on the screen that I didn't notice until few days later. Battery life, it all depends on how you use the phone but for every day of my use I've had absolutely incredible battery life, going to work, gym, hangouts and such, this phone lasts me all day! Performance is amazing which is to be expected from Apple, the IPhone's are already smooth be default with their animations, now imagine that with 120hz display... if you know what that is lol. The back of the phone is smooth and if you don't want it slipping then I highly recommend a case. Display is amazing which is no surprise for OLED, I accidentally dropped mine on the corner of my table and thought I killed my phone but it survived without a scratch. OS I like it alot especially with the apps they supply you with that you can uninstall of your choosing, this all depends on the user's preference. I do wish Apple placed the Action button where the power button is But I'll live, if you're left handed then you'll be fine. Overall, if you want a phone that works well.. this is your phone

Performance is amazing which is to be expected from Apple, the IPhone's are already smooth be default with their animations, now imagine that with 120hz display... if you know what that is lol. The back of the phone is smooth and if you don't want it slipping then I highly recommend a case. Display is amazing which is no surprise for OLED, I accidentally dropped mine on the corner of my table and thought I killed my phone but it survived without a scratch. OS I like it alot especially with the apps they supply you with that you can uninstall of your choosing, this all depends on the user's preference. I do wish Apple placed the Action button where the power button is But I'll live, if you're left handed then you'll be fine. Overall, if you want a phone that works well.. this is your phone

The phone is doing great job and after some adjustments within the settings I have my battery life up to 2.5 days before it 100% dies. In comparison to a new one, cause my girlfriends got one from the apple store (same make/model), I see that her phone does last a few extra hours longer on the last day but that's it. So this was a great buy and great experience and would recommend this product to anyone.For the delivery the phone came with no scratches or dings and looked brand new. It's like a brand new phone :)

It was the first time I've bought a refurbished phone, but it is worth the price difference.  Note: The cable included with the iPhone doesn't include the adapter (the blocky thing you plug into an outlet), so plan on buying one separately.  Amazon sells both adapters and cable cords and you'll need them, so you might as well add them when you buy the iPhone.

The only minor downside is the battery life is at 88% capacity (it's guaranteed over 80% so it's not too bad).Definitely would recommend it, especially since the Apple refurb for the same phone is double the price.

My package was delivered early but without the iPhone box; just wrapped up loose with the charger in a priority mailer box, which worried me. But once I plugged it in and got my data transfer going, everything worked great! I am very happy with my ""new"" phone. Looks flawless with no scratches. The camera works perfectly. The only minor downside is the battery life is at 88% capacity (it's guaranteed over 80% so it's not too bad).Definitely would recommend it, especially since the Apple refurb for the same phone is double the price.

And regret buying this way!!STAY CLEAR and go elsewhere if you want good quality and good customer service!

When i saw the reviews, i was worried, worried that i might get something else or the phone won't work. so i decided to do some research before purchasing it and once i convince myself to buy the phone and got it in my hands i have to say... THIS IS THE BEST IPHONE I EVER HAD(as someone who just switched to iphone from android) The phone was in Excellent condition, the battery life was Great, and no problems what so ever. Highly recommend to buy this iphone. Also your not missing much from the new ones except for the camera.(as far as i know so ye).

As you can see in my pictures, the phone just looks so lovely lol thank you again to the seller for giving me a great deal for $650. Yes I was scared to but this iPhone on amazon, I’ve never buy electronics online only in person. I needed a good deal on a great iPhone that’s going to last me a long time, I took my chances and I have no regrets. I truly recommend to buy,

When i saw the reviews, i was worried, worried that i might get something else or the phone won't work. so i decided to do some research before purchasing it and once i convince myself to buy the phone and got it in my hands i have to say... THIS IS THE BEST IPHONE I EVER HAD(as someone who just switched to iphone from android) The phone was in Excellent condition, the battery life was Great, and no problems what so ever. Highly recommend to buy this iphone. Also your not missing much from the new ones except for the camera.(as far as i know so ye).

As you can see in my pictures, the phone just looks so lovely lol thank you again to the seller for giving me a great deal for $650. Yes I was scared to but this iPhone on amazon, I’ve never buy electronics online only in person.

The phone looks brand new, not a scratch on it. Maybe I got lucky, but I can't find any discernable flaws that would leave someone to believe this isn't a new phone.  She is extremely happy with her new phone and now spends most of her time taking pictures of our daughter using portrait mode instead of cursing at her phone for crashing and causing her to miss the shot.

The battery life was way less than the 80% stated and got worst after every charge in my opinion! So FIRST RED FLAG - the SELLER LIED ABOUT THAT !!!I kept the phone despite this small inconvenience because it seemed to be a good phone. However now NOT even 1 YEAR after buying it, it has gotten so bad that I have to charge it multiple times a day as the battery is toast! The phone has started not fonctioning correctly, doesn’t open apps, doesn’t refresh apps when they do open, can’t call out. Can’t hear people when on the phone (when I can that is), the camera works from time to time.Just GARBAGE!! Contacted the Seller who basically tells me, isn’t there problem as I had 90 days to return! That’s great the phone was working up until NOW so that is NO HELP!!!!Also contacted AMAZON who were ALSO NO HELP, as again apparently not their problem!I need to contact Apple directly, who of course won’t help me because I didn’t buy it from them!So I am now 500$ down as it’s too late to go to my bank and cancel the transaction and with a phone that DOES NOT function so I had to buy a new one !!!!!!!!!!I will NEVER buy a refurbished phone from AMAZON or a 3rd party seller again! And regret buying this way!!STAY CLEAR and go elsewhere if you want good quality and good customer service!

Phone quality is very good and pictures look amazing.I have some glitches with notifications from various Apps, but don't know if it is phone or app's problem.  So glad it was unlocked.

I was looking for the 14 pro max but of course those are just a mythical creature good luck with that. Instead, Amazon had the 13 pro max IN STOCK with the Renewed Premium guarantee it was a no brainer. Came nicely packaged and secured, the box was nice and neat and felt great opening it. Actually I bought 2 of these in the same color, one for myself and one for my lady.As for the phone itself, what is there to say? Its an iPhone 13 Pro Max 128gb. Top of the line and compatible with the latest iOS and 5G. Love the phone, love iOS, love the speed of my phone. NO complaints.

Trabajo fotografía y video y este teléfono lo estoy usando literal para asuntos administrativos como para fotografías y videos. Esta funcionando al 100%. (el teléfono vino con el 95% de batería). Tenía 2 pequeños rayones en la pantalla. Muy pequeños la verdad. Con el vidrio templado ya ni se notan. Recomendaría comprar el cargador y cable del cargador de Apple Original. Para evitar dañar la batería del teléfono. El cargador y cable de cargador que trae la verdad se ve sencillo y yo en lo personal no me quise arriesgar en arruinar la batería. Voy a volver a comprar Renovado Premium. La verdad ahorre bastante dinero comprando de esta manera.

Trabajo fotografía y video y este teléfono lo estoy usando literal para asuntos administrativos como para fotografías y videos. Esta funcionando al 100%. (el teléfono vino con el 95% de batería). Tenía 2 pequeños rayones en la pantalla. Muy pequeños la verdad. Con el vidrio templado ya ni se notan. Recomendaría comprar el cargador y cable del cargador de Apple Original. Para evitar dañar la batería del teléfono. El cargador y cable de cargador que trae la verdad se ve sencillo y yo en lo personal no me quise arriesgar en arruinar la batería.

I’ve had no issues at all. It came with a charger and was all packaged very well. It was super easy to transfer everything on my old iPhone to this one, and then to transfer service using eSIM.

My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I’ve had no issues at all. It came with a charger and was all packaged very well. It was super easy to transfer everything on my old iPhone to this one, and then to transfer service using eSIM. I received advance communication from the seller about how to contact them if there is any problem with the phone, which was reassuring. I’m very happy with this purchase, the seller, and the phone itself.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I called Cricket and was put on hold for a long time until an unhelpful person told me I need to call Amazon if I have questions.I call Amazon and ask about porting my phone number. Amazon is very friendly but we agree they can't tell me how to port my AT&T number to Cricket. They ask me to call Cricket back.I call Cricket back and was put on hold for a long time before an unhelpful person told me I need to go to a Cricket store to ask questions or activate the phone.I call Amazon back to complain about the bait and switch and try to reverse everything. Amazon rep is very friendly and starts a return. I love the iPhone 12 Max Pro and wish I could keep it, but I have to return to Amazon and buy from a different company.I thought Amazon would protect me from the monstrous practices of Cricket but they don't. Its odd Amazon allows allows Cricket to do this.

Face recognition was something I had to get used to since I was transitioning from a phone with a home button to a full screen display. Once I got used to it, it’s actually pretty easy to use, and it still grants me access even with my glasses on!  Storage capacity is great, will be ending more tho haha overall, I’m super happy with my purchase and since I was already with cricket, the process was super easy!

This iPhone has great battery life, I could be watching videos for long periods of time and I still won’t need to charge up until the end of the day. Face recognition was something I had to get used to since I was transitioning from a phone with a home button to a full screen display. Once I got used to it, it’s actually pretty easy to use, and it still grants me access even with my glasses on!  Storage capacity is great, will be ending more tho haha overall, I’m super happy with my purchase and since I was already with cricket, the process was super easy!

I called Cricket and was put on hold for a long time until an unhelpful person told me I need to call Amazon if I have questions.I call Amazon and ask about porting my phone number. Amazon is very friendly but we agree they can't tell me how to port my AT&T number to Cricket. They ask me to call Cricket back.I call Cricket back and was put on hold for a long time before an unhelpful person told me I need to go to a Cricket store to ask questions or activate the phone.I call Amazon back to complain about the bait and switch and try to reverse everything. Amazon rep is very friendly and starts a return. I love the iPhone 12 Max Pro and wish I could keep it, but I have to return to Amazon and buy from a different company.I thought Amazon would protect me from the monstrous practices of Cricket but they don't. Its odd Amazon allows allows Cricket to do this.

Though it WAS fully unlocked, my carrier is lame and said the phone was not compatible (but they say that about the iPhone I am currently using on their network, so take from that what you will). I checked other sites out of curiosity and the unlocked 3rd Gen SE would have worked just fine. I didn't want the headache of arguing with my provider's customer service, so I returned the phone - following the clear directions inside the box (sign out of your iCloud and reset phone).

Yes, yes, yes. I can't believe how this cell phone costs 1/4 the price of a new one yet looks and functions as if it were! excellent condition, no scratch on it, no dust in the charging port, and no marks anywhere. I spent multiple days comparing several devices and sellers b/c I want/must carry small phones for ease and comfort for my hands, pockets, and general life usage.  Have a Samsung S24, huge, had an Apple 4.7"" 10 years ago, compared all sides of the equation for a new device b/c I'm sick of carrying cells, aka ""bricks"", that won't fit in my pockets or purse, cup holders in my John Deere tractor, Husq Zero Turn, and Ford Explorer (Eddie Bauer edition with leather seat that is now damaged where the back pocket connects with the seat cushion and cell phone that stuck out when I hopped up into the truck and forgot about the darn ""brick pocket' situation I had going on back there. Amazon is phenomenal, you did a great big favor selling me this phone for roughly 1/4 the cost of one from Apple, and thank you Apple for partnering with Amazon and selling so many in bulk because of potential;y that's how I was able to secure one for less than $150.  I got the wall charger, power cord, and a white phone in mint condition. This product is amazing, highly recommend it. Oh- and it will fit in my purse, on the dashboard phone holder contraption without breaking my vent, and doesn't fall out of pockets on the front, side, or back THANKS AMAZON! Finally, my poor little hands thank you as well, now they won't be forced to stretch to the outer limits just to use the phone.

Though it WAS fully unlocked, my carrier is lame and said the phone was not compatible (but they say that about the iPhone I am currently using on their network, so take from that what you will). I checked other sites out of curiosity and the unlocked 3rd Gen SE would have worked just fine.

Though it WAS fully unlocked, my carrier is lame and said the phone was not compatible (but they say that about the iPhone I am currently using on their network, so take from that what you will). I checked other sites out of curiosity and the unlocked 3rd Gen SE would have worked just fine. I didn't want the headache of arguing with my provider's customer service, so I returned the phone - following the clear directions inside the box (sign out of your iCloud and reset phone). I received a full refund the same day it arrived back to Hybrid IT. Though the phone didn't work for me, I was very happy with the item that was shipped to me and the speed that I was refunded.

I examined the entire phone with a magnifying glass and the only negative was a tiny amount of lint(?) in the charging port - the only evidence that it had been used. I had the SE 2020 for the past almost five years, and loved the phone. Unfortunately, I managed to smash the screen in a freak accident. I was ready to purchasing a brand new 15 thinking that was what I should do, but I came to my senses and thought why? I use my phone for texts and calls mostly, and for taking pictures and some internet searches, and the old phone suited my needs just fine. I like the home button format on the SE, and I don't like having to swipe for everything on the other iPhones. Also, I carry my phone in my pockets on a daily two hour dog walk through very rough desert terrain, so it is exposed to dust, sand, heat, sweat, etc., and it endures all of that and then some. So, I ""upgraded"" to a SE2022 and went with an Amazon refurbished premium in red, because red was another twenty dollars less (who cares about color?). I got a better phone for half the price of a new one. I have been using it for 24 hours and it is like I never missed a beat. The SIM card transfer and iCloud download was easy and relatively quick - all my data was there, so very little set up was required. The battery health says 94%, which is better than the 83% that was on my old phone last time I checked it before the accident, so I assume it will take a couple of years or so to get this one down to that level, and I wasn't bothered by the old phones performance with the low battery. I am an old guy who doesn't live on a phone like younger people do, so paying a thousand bucks or so for a bunch of features I would never utilize doesn't make any sense. The SE iPhones take great photos, by the way.

Absolutely no scratches or dings, terrific battery life, and smooth transfer of my current iPhone to the newer SE.Full disclosure, I did have to send the phone back.. Though it WAS fully unlocked, my carrier is lame and said the phone was not compatible (but they say that about the iPhone I am currently using on their network, so take from that what you will). I checked other sites out of curiosity and the unlocked 3rd Gen SE would have worked just fine. I didn't want the headache of arguing with my provider's customer service, so I returned the phone - following the clear directions inside the box (sign out of your iCloud and reset phone). I received a full refund the same day it arrived back to Hybrid IT. Though the phone didn't work for me, I was very happy with the item that was shipped to me and the speed that I was refunded.

I examined the entire phone with a magnifying glass and the only negative was a tiny amount of lint(?) in the charging port - the only evidence that it had been used. I had the SE 2020 for the past almost five years, and loved the phone. Unfortunately, I managed to smash the screen in a freak accident. I was ready to purchasing a brand new 15 thinking that was what I should do, but I came to my senses and thought why? I use my phone for texts and calls mostly, and for taking pictures and some internet searches, and the old phone suited my needs just fine. I like the home button format on the SE, and I don't like having to swipe for everything on the other iPhones. Also, I carry my phone in my pockets on a daily two hour dog walk through very rough desert terrain, so it is exposed to dust, sand, heat, sweat, etc., and it endures all of that and then some. So, I ""upgraded"" to a SE2022 and went with an Amazon refurbished premium in red, because red was another twenty dollars less (who cares about color?). I got a better phone for half the price of a new one. I have been using it for 24 hours and it is like I never missed a beat. The SIM card transfer and iCloud download was easy and relatively quick - all my data was there, so very little set up was required. The battery health says 94%, which is better than the 83% that was on my old phone last time I checked it before the accident, so I assume it will take a couple of years or so to get this one down to that level, and I wasn't bothered by the old phones performance with the low battery. I am an old guy who doesn't live on a phone like younger people do, so paying a thousand bucks or so for a bunch of features I would never utilize doesn't make any sense. The SE iPhones take great photos, by the way.

The good: the phone I received was in mint condition and the battery was 100%. The bad: the phone was listed as Verizon compatible, but it would not recognize the SIM card from my Verizon SE2. Checked Settings and found that the phone was “SIM Locked”. Spent an hour digging on the internet and another 45 minutes on the phone with Apple support and they finally determined that the phone was registered to “Cox Communication” and Apple could not unlock the phone. Took phone to Verizon store (supposed to be Verizon compatible, right?), but they couldn’t help either. Searched Internet again, found customer support # for Cox Communications, navigated their phone tree, finally spoke to Tech Support, but since I was not a customer, they couldn’t unlock the phone either. Called Amazon, initiated return, now waiting for UPS to pick up phone and will now have to wait 4+ weeks for credit to post.  Hours spent. Way too much effort for no result.

Amazon is phenomenal, you did a great big favor selling me this phone for roughly 1/4 the cost of one from Apple, and thank you Apple for partnering with Amazon and selling so many in bulk because of potential;y that's how I was able to secure one for less than $150.  I got the wall charger, power cord, and a white phone in mint condition. This product is amazing, highly recommend it. Oh- and it will fit in my purse, on the dashboard phone holder contraption without breaking my vent, and doesn't fall out of pockets on the front, side, or back THANKS AMAZON!

The screen, speed, camera, software, are the best you can buy. Plus, it's the last generation sold in the states with a SIM drawer. For someone that travels a lot, and uses foreign SIM cards, it's a must.I bought an identical phone as a present, a refurbished model. It was SOLD and SHIPPED by Amazon. Condition was described as Excellent. It arrived in a brown box with a USB A cable and a power adapter (brand new phones from Apple are shipped WITHOUT power adapter). The phone looked brand new, not a single mark anywhere. The thing I was worried about the most was battery health. I charged the phone and it showed 100% battery health!I am very happy with this purchase, it cost half of what I paid for mine, and will last at least another 5 years.

Have you been able to send another one that you are in really good condition? You will be in the city of Orlando until March 29th at the Hotel Monreale. If this is not possible, I will unfortunately cancel the purchase. I took photos, if you want I can send them to you. Thanks. That’s right, Cláudio Correa.

I just wanted to keep the same phone number that I have been using for years with Metro. Besides the Cricket SIM Card didn’t work, they said the SIM card is the correct one but I needed a new card and they told me to request another card through Amazon with no explanation why the first one didn’t work. But I was afraid a new SIM card could’t work either. So because the disappointing Cricket customer service I had to return a nice good iPhone eleven 😞.

The last iPhone I owned was the 3G in 2010, and I'm switching over from the Pixel 3. I used an iPhone 8 plus while waiting for the 11 to get here so I can kind of compare it to that phone for the purpose of the review!I left Google because the Pixel was just totally failing me. Constantly overheating, like constant, I no joke was sticking my phone in the refrigerator all day. I'm a heavy camera and Spotify user, and the overheating of the Pixel made a) the battery drain so bad that I could barely use it between charging, b) charge incredibly slow, and c) just run slow in general to the point that it felt like I really just could never use my phone.Then one day my Pixel just decided to stop charging and it's barely a year old. I was fed up. I asked all my family members if their iPhones ever had overheating problems and everyone said no, so I decided I need a new phone anyway, I'll give Apple a chance.Here are my Pro and Cons of the 11 64GB:Pros:- Does not overheat at all so far. I've used it exactly the same as I used my Pixel, taking and editing pictures and videos all day and playing Spotify, and the few times it has gotten a little warm, it cooled off FAST. So far overheating is not an issue, which is fantastic.- Runs really smoothly. Compared to the 8 Plus both running iOS 14, the UI and navigation feel far more smooth, everything feels pretty organic. It's a noticeable difference if you switch from an iPhone that's 3+ years old. Android is a smooth experience as well so I wouldn't say it's better, but I can tell apps are primarily designed with iOS in mind and so the experience feels a little more advanced.- Camera so far seems great. Compared to the 8 Plus it's lightyears better. Clearer, better colors, faster. Compared to the Pixel 3, quality doesn't seem much different, but I like the color profile better, it's warmer in a nice way. And it doesn't overheat, so you can actually use it.- Battery life is amazing so far. Doesn't seem like it's draining at all with pretty heavy useage, or at least useage that would kill my Pixel in about 10 minutes. Better than the 8 Plus also.- Price is pretty good right now.- Comes in some really nice colors. The purple is seriously cute.- Much easier to integrate if you're a non-Apple user than it was 10 years ago lol- Face lock seems fine. I don't miss the fingerprint reader as much as I thought I would. I do kind of miss the reader on the back of the Pixel but it's not a deal breaker.- I like iMessage, it's actually a really nice experience and feels more involved than regular texting. Google has some version of it but none of my friends or family has an Android so it's pointless lol- Cons:- I do have one issue with the UI and I noticed it in the 8 Plus as well, but have never noticed it on a Google phone. That is the touch screen in the corners seems to misfire or just not react at all. I'm still figuring out how to use back arrows the correct way because my phone just doesn't register what I think is me tapping things in the corners. It's a little frustrating. I'm not sure what the deal is.- The physical design is bulky. Bulkier than the Pixel 3. It doesn't bother me per se and I assume the body stays cooler because of it, but it makes it feel a little... old I guess. It also has a pretty thick border around the screen that makes it look a little older as well. But if it means the phone runs better, I'll take it.- The Gmail app shows the number of outstanding emails I have and honestly it bothers me lol. Google phones don't do this and I wish I could turn it off somehow... (can I?). I don't want to be reminded that I'm terrible at cleaning my inbox and have thousands of unread junk emails haunting me.- It bugs me that you have to pay monthly for iCloud storage. You get 15GB free with Google Photos but only 5GB with iCloud, and if you want more you have to pay monthly. I'd rather just pay a lump sum up front for extra storage.- Doesn't come with the wall plug for charging, just the cord... what the?!

However the  phone is really nice I couldn’t activate it. I called the Cricket customer service and every time I called  they told me something new. I just wanted to keep the same phone number that I have been using for years with Metro. Besides the Cricket SIM Card didn’t work, they said the SIM card is the correct one but I needed a new card and they told me to request another card through Amazon with no explanation why the first one didn’t work. But I was afraid a new SIM card could’t work either. So because the disappointing Cricket customer service I had to return a nice good iPhone eleven 😞. I returned the phone on January 22, It means  seven weeks ago and I’m still waiting for my money back. I  don’t recommend this Cricket on line. I had to get in person on another carrier and they did all the job & I can keep the same phone #.

The last iPhone I owned was the 3G in 2010, and I'm switching over from the Pixel 3. I used an iPhone 8 plus while waiting for the 11 to get here so I can kind of compare it to that phone for the purpose of the review!I left Google because the Pixel was just totally failing me. Constantly overheating, like constant, I no joke was sticking my phone in the refrigerator all day. I'm a heavy camera and Spotify user, and the overheating of the Pixel made a) the battery drain so bad that I could barely use it between charging, b) charge incredibly slow, and c) just run slow in general to the point that it felt like I really just could never use my phone.Then one day my Pixel just decided to stop charging and it's barely a year old. I was fed up. I asked all my family members if their iPhones ever had overheating problems and everyone said no, so I decided I need a new phone anyway, I'll give Apple a chance.Here are my Pro and Cons of the 11 64GB:Pros:- Does not overheat at all so far. I've used it exactly the same as I used my Pixel, taking and editing pictures and videos all day and playing Spotify, and the few times it has gotten a little warm, it cooled off FAST. So far overheating is not an issue, which is fantastic.- Runs really smoothly. Compared to the 8 Plus both running iOS 14, the UI and navigation feel far more smooth, everything feels pretty organic. It's a noticeable difference if you switch from an iPhone that's 3+ years old. Android is a smooth experience as well so I wouldn't say it's better, but I can tell apps are primarily designed with iOS in mind and so the experience feels a little more advanced.- Camera so far seems great. Compared to the 8 Plus it's lightyears better. Clearer, better colors, faster. Compared to the Pixel 3, quality doesn't seem much different, but I like the color profile better, it's warmer in a nice way. And it doesn't overheat, so you can actually use it.- Battery life is amazing so far. Doesn't seem like it's draining at all with pretty heavy useage, or at least useage that would kill my Pixel in about 10 minutes. Better than the 8 Plus also.- Price is pretty good right now.- Comes in some really nice colors. The purple is seriously cute.- Much easier to integrate if you're a non-Apple user than it was 10 years ago lol- Face lock seems fine. I don't miss the fingerprint reader as much as I thought I would.

Google has some version of it but none of my friends or family has an Android so it's pointless lol- Cons:- I do have one issue with the UI and I noticed it in the 8 Plus as well, but have never noticed it on a Google phone. That is the touch screen in the corners seems to misfire or just not react at all. I'm still figuring out how to use back arrows the correct way because my phone just doesn't register what I think is me tapping things in the corners. It's a little frustrating.

However the  phone is really nice I couldn’t activate it. I called the Cricket customer service and every time I called  they told me something new. I just wanted to keep the same phone number that I have been using for years with Metro. Besides the Cricket SIM Card didn’t work, they said the SIM card is the correct one but I needed a new card and they told me to request another card through Amazon with no explanation why the first one didn’t work. But I was afraid a new SIM card could’t work either. So because the disappointing Cricket customer service I had to return a nice good iPhone eleven 😞. I returned the phone on January 22, It means  seven weeks ago and I’m still waiting for my money back. I  don’t recommend this Cricket on line. I had to get in person on another carrier and they did all the job & I can keep the same phone #.

The last iPhone I owned was the 3G in 2010, and I'm switching over from the Pixel 3. I used an iPhone 8 plus while waiting for the 11 to get here so I can kind of compare it to that phone for the purpose of the review!I left Google because the Pixel was just totally failing me. Constantly overheating, like constant, I no joke was sticking my phone in the refrigerator all day. I'm a heavy camera and Spotify user, and the overheating of the Pixel made a) the battery drain so bad that I could barely use it between charging, b) charge incredibly slow, and c) just run slow in general to the point that it felt like I really just could never use my phone.Then one day my Pixel just decided to stop charging and it's barely a year old. I was fed up. I asked all my family members if their iPhones ever had overheating problems and everyone said no, so I decided I need a new phone anyway, I'll give Apple a chance.Here are my Pro and Cons of the 11 64GB:Pros:- Does not overheat at all so far. I've used it exactly the same as I used my Pixel, taking and editing pictures and videos all day and playing Spotify, and the few times it has gotten a little warm, it cooled off FAST. So far overheating is not an issue, which is fantastic.- Runs really smoothly. Compared to the 8 Plus both running iOS 14, the UI and navigation feel far more smooth, everything feels pretty organic. It's a noticeable difference if you switch from an iPhone that's 3+ years old. Android is a smooth experience as well so I wouldn't say it's better, but I can tell apps are primarily designed with iOS in mind and so the experience feels a little more advanced.- Camera so far seems great. Compared to the 8 Plus it's lightyears better. Clearer, better colors, faster. Compared to the Pixel 3, quality doesn't seem much different, but I like the color profile better, it's warmer in a nice way. And it doesn't overheat, so you can actually use it.- Battery life is amazing so far. Doesn't seem like it's draining at all with pretty heavy useage, or at least useage that would kill my Pixel in about 10 minutes. Better than the 8 Plus also.- Price is pretty good right now.- Comes in some really nice colors. The purple is seriously cute.- Much easier to integrate if you're a non-Apple user than it was 10 years ago lol- Face lock seems fine. I don't miss the fingerprint reader as much as I thought I would. I do kind of miss the reader on the back of the Pixel but it's not a deal breaker.- I like iMessage, it's actually a really nice experience and feels more involved than regular texting. Google has some version of it but none of my friends or family has an Android so it's pointless lol- Cons:- I do have one issue with the UI and I noticed it in the 8 Plus as well, but have never noticed it on a Google phone. That is the touch screen in the corners seems to misfire or just not react at all. I'm still figuring out how to use back arrows the correct way because my phone just doesn't register what I think is me tapping things in the corners. It's a little frustrating. I'm not sure what the deal is.- The physical design is bulky. Bulkier than the Pixel 3. It doesn't bother me per se and I assume the body stays cooler because of it, but it makes it feel a little... old I guess. It also has a pretty thick border around the screen that makes it look a little older as well. But if it means the phone runs better, I'll take it.- The Gmail app shows the number of outstanding emails I have and honestly it bothers me lol. Google phones don't do this and I wish I could turn it off somehow... (can I?). I don't want to be reminded that I'm terrible at cleaning my inbox and have thousands of unread junk emails haunting me.- It bugs me that you have to pay monthly for iCloud storage. You get 15GB free with Google Photos but only 5GB with iCloud, and if you want more you have to pay monthly. I'd rather just pay a lump sum up front for extra storage.- Doesn't come with the wall plug for charging, just the cord... what the?!

It brings back memories when I used a space gray one in my early 20's as it was first introduced. This type of iPhone is so awesome, that I voluntarily downgraded from a red iPhone SE (2nd Generation)! I made sure that I did everything respectively: iCloud Backup my old iPhone, replace my SIM card, charge it for two hours (as timely instructed), go through the setup, and then I finally enjoyed my ""new"" phone. Apart from the case, mine also came with a charger, screen protector, SIM tray tool, and a thank you letter. I like how it fits in the palm of my hand and how the display looks. I feel more like myself with my new product and that makes me happy.I am using iOS 15 so I'm weary about the future of security and compatibility for my refurbished silver iPhone SE (1st Generation) but no matter what, this will always be my favorite iPhone ever, because phones will only get bigger (for some odd reason, I don't know why people want this) and I prefer my small iPhone.

I made sure that I did everything respectively: iCloud Backup my old iPhone, replace my SIM card, charge it for two hours (as timely instructed), go through the setup, and then I finally enjoyed my ""new"" phone. Apart from the case, mine also came with a charger, screen protector, SIM tray tool, and a thank you letter. I like how it fits in the palm of my hand and how the display looks. I feel more like myself with my new product and that makes me happy.I am using iOS 15 so I'm weary about the future of security and compatibility for my refurbished silver iPhone SE (1st Generation) but no matter what, this will always be my favorite iPhone ever, because phones will only get bigger (for some odd reason, I don't know why people want this) and I prefer my small iPhone.

Especially for a 500gb model. BUT the listing also claimed it was in excellent condition. And tbh after a few days I can’t agree. There’s two small chips in the front screen, three small chips around the edge of the back glass, scratches and scrapes around the entire edge of the frame, and possibly most importantly is the battery is only at 84 capacity. Now the battery still lasts me all day and then some BUT its very obvious that this phone wasn’t opened, fixed, or renewed at all because at the very least that should have been replaced especially for “excellent” quality. It’s a gamble with renewed stuff and I’ll live, especially once I have a case on it but this definitely shouldn’t have been marked the way it was and I’d be terrified to see what “good” or “acceptable” condition looks like.

We didn't really need to as our XR's were running fine, and quite reliable, but we fell into the hype. Dropped a bunch of money to get these phones and have overall had a bad experience. Yeah, the camera is pretty great. I do like the wide angle lens, and night photos look better. The screen is slightly better, but really not by much. We did side to side next to our XRs and we could really only tell a difference on super HD videos. The metal casing of the Pro's looks pretty slick. And that's all the good I have to say about them.First off, the battery seems worse than my XR. I never recall charging my XR throughout the day, but I find by the evening I'm worrying about my Pro's battery and hunting for a charger. Really frustrating. And that's with 5G turned off. Which, by the way, doesn't seem to make a noticeable difference unless you're in a 5G hot area. I haven't noticed any difference in speed with it on or off.And as for durability, my wife was waiting for her phone case to arrive in the mail and so was carrying it around without a case for a few days (we figured the ads saying it was super durable glass meant that it could handle itself) but she dropped it one time as she was getting out of the car, and after falling 2-3 feet, the back of the entire phone shattered. So much for durability.And finally, if it couldn't be more annoying, it seems to have weird little glitches that our old phones never had. The bluetooth sometimes cuts out from my Airpods, sound notifications change in volume suddenly and randomly, and worst of all, whenever I have it mounted in my car for GPS, if it sits in the sun for more than 10 minutes the screen just goes super dark. Like it's still at 100% brightness but it looks like it's at 40%. Makes it impossible to see when driving and it doesn't fix itself for like an hour. Haven't figured out a solution to that, but it's very frustrating when you need it to work.Overall, yeah, it's an Apple IPhone. It's still a good device with a great camera, etc. But compared to cheaper and older models, it's a ripoff in my experience, especially for how expensive it is, and how it calls itself ""pro"". If I could return it and get my old phone I would. I'd highly recommend getting the cheaper 12, or just sticking with the 11 or XR if you have them. I'd wait until they improve this disappointing model.

The phone seemed fine at first but when I started the setup it turned out the face ID camera didn't work. Went to apple, they said I had to replace the mechanism for the face ID for $250. Requested a return to have it replaced, the package slip gave me a date to ship it by. After I shipped, company says it's past the return date. I told them the package slip said I could return it before a certain time. I then showed them all the evidence I had that the phone arrived to me faulty, showing the printout of what Apple said and the date which was 3 days after I purchased the phone. Even then they wouldn't help me and asked me to purchase a shipping slip so they can ship the phone back to me. Now I have to get the phone fixed myself. Forget about support too because it takes forever for them to get back to you if you have an issue with your phone. Even after all the evidence they still couldn't do the right thing. Bad company, avoid at all cost.

The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and snappy performance, and the camera system delivers exceptional image quality. The display is stunning with its vibrant colors and high resolution, providing an immersive viewing experience. The device's build quality is excellent, as expected from Apple, and the design is sleek and premium.However, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a battery health of 83%, I was hoping for better battery performance with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the battery health of my new device was also at 83%. Considering the hefty price tag of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I expected a better battery health out of the box.That being said, the iPhone 13 Pro Max does offer a longer-lasting battery compared to its predecessor. With moderate usage, I can comfortably get through a full day without needing to recharge. I hope that this battery health issue doesn't lead to the same battery problems I encountered with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, where it struggled to hold a charge effectively.Aside from the battery health concern, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a powerful and feature-rich device that caters to the needs of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The improved performance, exceptional camera capabilities, and stunning display make it a top contender in the smartphone market.In conclusion, the iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an overall positive experience with its impressive performance and features. However, the disappointment lies in the battery health, which was the same as my previous iPhone. I'm hopeful that the battery life remains consistent and doesn't deteriorate rapidly over time. If Apple can address this issue and improve the battery health of their devices, the iPhone 13 Pro Max would unquestionably be a top-notch smartphone choice.

The problem is that Mr hatefulness got it for me for my birthday and he got it on a payment plan under his name cut the bill then wanted me to pay for my birthday gift he chose to make payments on. I refuse to pay for a gift so I got myself a cheap phone for the time. Now I got this phone. It’s supposed to be excellent quality… But the speaker on this phone is nowhere near as good as my other iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1tb that Mr hatefulness got me but refuses to pay for. I use that phone on WiFi and listen to my music on that phone at home but when I get away from the signal I’m stuck with a crappy speaker phone. 🫨 I guess I expected excellent quality instead of just good quality speaker since I paid for excellent quality phone. Crazy that my old phones speaker works so much better. All in all it’s a great phone I’m just really into music which is why I got the phone with the 1tb memory. So I can save my music to my phone. That and cuz I have like 7 TikTok’s. They keep shutting me down.

The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and snappy performance, and the camera system delivers exceptional image quality. The display is stunning with its vibrant colors and high resolution, providing an immersive viewing experience. The device's build quality is excellent, as expected from Apple, and the design is sleek and premium.However, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a battery health of 83%, I was hoping for better battery performance with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the battery health of my new device was also at 83%. Considering the hefty price tag of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I expected a better battery health out of the box.That being said, the iPhone 13 Pro Max does offer a longer-lasting battery compared to its predecessor. With moderate usage, I can comfortably get through a full day without needing to recharge. I hope that this battery health issue doesn't lead to the same battery problems I encountered with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, where it struggled to hold a charge effectively.Aside from the battery health concern, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a powerful and feature-rich device that caters to the needs of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The improved performance, exceptional camera capabilities, and stunning display make it a top contender in the smartphone market.In conclusion, the iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an overall positive experience with its impressive performance and features. However, the disappointment lies in the battery health, which was the same as my previous iPhone. I'm hopeful that the battery life remains consistent and doesn't deteriorate rapidly over time. If Apple can address this issue and improve the battery health of their devices, the iPhone 13 Pro Max would unquestionably be a top-notch smartphone choice.

The problem is that Mr hatefulness got it for me for my birthday and he got it on a payment plan under his name cut the bill then wanted me to pay for my birthday gift he chose to make payments on. I refuse to pay for a gift so I got myself a cheap phone for the time. Now I got this phone. It’s supposed to be excellent quality… But the speaker on this phone is nowhere near as good as my other iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1tb that Mr hatefulness got me but refuses to pay for. I use that phone on WiFi and listen to my music on that phone at home but when I get away from the signal I’m stuck with a crappy speaker phone. 🫨 I guess I expected excellent quality instead of just good quality speaker since I paid for excellent quality phone. Crazy that my old phones speaker works so much better. All in all it’s a great phone I’m just really into music which is why I got the phone with the 1tb memory. So I can save my music to my phone. That and cuz I have like 7 TikTok’s. They keep shutting me down.

The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and snappy performance, and the camera system delivers exceptional image quality. The display is stunning with its vibrant colors and high resolution, providing an immersive viewing experience. The device's build quality is excellent, as expected from Apple, and the design is sleek and premium.However, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a battery health of 83%, I was hoping for better battery performance with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the battery health of my new device was also at 83%. Considering the hefty price tag of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I expected a better battery health out of the box.That being said, the iPhone 13 Pro Max does offer a longer-lasting battery compared to its predecessor. With moderate usage, I can comfortably get through a full day without needing to recharge. I hope that this battery health issue doesn't lead to the same battery problems I encountered with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, where it struggled to hold a charge effectively.Aside from the battery health concern, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a powerful and feature-rich device that caters to the needs of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The improved performance, exceptional camera capabilities, and stunning display make it a top contender in the smartphone market.In conclusion, the iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an overall positive experience with its impressive performance and features. However, the disappointment lies in the battery health, which was the same as my previous iPhone. I'm hopeful that the battery life remains consistent and doesn't deteriorate rapidly over time. If Apple can address this issue and improve the battery health of their devices, the iPhone 13 Pro Max would unquestionably be a top-notch smartphone choice.

The problem is that Mr hatefulness got it for me for my birthday and he got it on a payment plan under his name cut the bill then wanted me to pay for my birthday gift he chose to make payments on. I refuse to pay for a gift so I got myself a cheap phone for the time. Now I got this phone. It’s supposed to be excellent quality… But the speaker on this phone is nowhere near as good as my other iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1tb that Mr hatefulness got me but refuses to pay for. I use that phone on WiFi and listen to my music on that phone at home but when I get away from the signal I’m stuck with a crappy speaker phone. 🫨 I guess I expected excellent quality instead of just good quality speaker since I paid for excellent quality phone. Crazy that my old phones speaker works so much better. All in all it’s a great phone I’m just really into music which is why I got the phone with the 1tb memory. So I can save my music to my phone. That and cuz I have like 7 TikTok’s. They keep shutting me down.

From a sleek ergonomic design to high-end features and functionality, 12 offers a great user experience. Some of those features include: Siri (the voice command utility), Safari (Apple’s search engine), Apple Pay (electronic wallet pays system), and FaceTime (video-conferencing App). These features help to keep die-hard iPhone lovers in a state of euphoria.  Apple has outclassed and out-designed most other tech giants with each iteration of the iPhone. The competition is adding various bells and whistles to their smartphones, in an attempt to surpass the popularity and sales of the iPhone. iPhone remains a top resale and trade-back phone due to quality, high rated reviews, workmanship, and the Apple brand. Every product line that Apple offers is seamlessly connected through iCloud. You can start a movie on your MacBook and finish it later on your iPhone. Emails can be sent from an Apple Watch and replies read from the iPad. Staying connected to people and content has never been easier or more portable.

Not only did I manage to snag it for an incredible price of $893 after tax, compared to its original $1600 price tag, but it has exceeded all my expectations.First off, let's talk about the display – it's a solid 10 out of 10. The vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and smooth responsiveness make every interaction a joy. The edges and sides score slightly lower at 8 out of 10, but they still feel premium and comfortable in hand. The back, however, is a perfect 10 – sleek, elegant, and practically smudge-proof.One of the best features of this phone is its massive storage capacity. Coming from an iPhone 11 with 128GB, upgrading to 1TB felt like going from a bicycle to a Ferrari. I no longer have to worry about deleting photos, videos, or apps to make space – I can keep everything I need right on my phone.In terms of functionality, the phone is flawless. No dead pixels, fast charging with MagSafe, and every feature working seamlessly. Sure, it didn't come in the original box, but that's a minor detail compared to the savings I got.Overall, I'd rate the condition of the phone at a solid 9.5 out of 10, considering both functionality and appearance. It's a sleek, powerful device that has completely transformed my mobile experience. If you're in the market for a top-of-the-line smartphone without breaking the bank, look no further than the iPhone 13 Pro Max 1TB – you won't be disappointed!

The screen was in great condition, no scratches since the original owner kept it in a case. However, when I received the phone, it took only a couple days to notice a grainy, distorted sound coming from the top speaker to hear phone calls or music. Every time I received a call or played music or anything with sound it had a grainy, scratchy, distorted sound coming out. It was so bad that I had to play everything on speaker phone mode just to avoid the scratchy distorted sound. I took it to an Apple Store genius bar and they confirmed that the Top Speaker was damaged and the original owner never bothered to repair it, she just sold the phone to a refurb dealer and it ended up as an ""Excellent"" condition phone sold through Amazon -- which I had the unfortunate luxury of purchasing. I could return it, HOWEVER, I live in Europe, so I had to find a friend who was flying back to the States and plead with her to return it in her luggage in the States. It was a nightmare experience. And my first time purchasing a refurbished iPhone.

The screen was in great condition, no scratches since the original owner kept it in a case. However, when I received the phone, it took only a couple days to notice a grainy, distorted sound coming from the top speaker to hear phone calls or music. Every time I received a call or played music or anything with sound it had a grainy, scratchy, distorted sound coming out. It was so bad that I had to play everything on speaker phone mode just to avoid the scratchy distorted sound. I took it to an Apple Store genius bar and they confirmed that the Top Speaker was damaged and the original owner never bothered to repair it, she just sold the phone to a refurb dealer and it ended up as an ""Excellent"" condition phone sold through Amazon -- which I had the unfortunate luxury of purchasing. I could return it, HOWEVER, I live in Europe, so I had to find a friend who was flying back to the States and plead with her to return it in her luggage in the States. It was a nightmare experience. And my first time purchasing a refurbished iPhone.

I’m glad I was able to buy a new phone with the much needed space and quality without having to spend almost $1000 for a brand new phone from the Apple Store. The phone came in perfect condition, no scratches on the body of the phone or the screen. The brightness (specs) is perfect, battery life is 100%, runs very smoothly, and has the 1TB of space as promised.It’s best to just buy excellent condition because buying anything refurbished is really a “you get what you pay for” kind of process!

The screen was in great condition, no scratches since the original owner kept it in a case. However, when I received the phone, it took only a couple days to notice a grainy, distorted sound coming from the top speaker to hear phone calls or music. Every time I received a call or played music or anything with sound it had a grainy, scratchy, distorted sound coming out. It was so bad that I had to play everything on speaker phone mode just to avoid the scratchy distorted sound. I took it to an Apple Store genius bar and they confirmed that the Top Speaker was damaged and the original owner never bothered to repair it, she just sold the phone to a refurb dealer and it ended up as an ""Excellent"" condition phone sold through Amazon -- which I had the unfortunate luxury of purchasing. I could return it, HOWEVER, I live in Europe, so I had to find a friend who was flying back to the States and plead with her to return it in her luggage in the States. It was a nightmare experience. And my first time purchasing a refurbished iPhone.

I’m glad I was able to buy a new phone with the much needed space and quality without having to spend almost $1000 for a brand new phone from the Apple Store. The phone came in perfect condition, no scratches on the body of the phone or the screen. The brightness (specs) is perfect, battery life is 100%, runs very smoothly, and has the 1TB of space as promised.It’s best to just buy excellent condition because buying anything refurbished is really a “you get what you pay for” kind of process!

Amazon sold and shipped this one with a one year warranty.  I wasn't able to do an old phone to new phone direct app/data transfer, but restoring a backup from my old phone to this new one went well.  Installing an eSIM went quickly, so no need to order a physical SIM from my carrier.  The dimensions of this phone are actually smaller than my SE, but the mini uses more of it's screen, so it is like upgrading to a larger screen.  The processing speed of this phone is great also.

Seemed a bit excessive to me.

I’ve waited to upgrade for a few years and everything is night and day better. Amazon makes this experience terrible though. They lock your sim so you can only buy cards from them. I canceled prime and can no longer buy this card and the ONLY way around it is to buy another sim. So in review, IPhone 13 is great and worth the upgrade if you are a few generations behind.

I’ve waited to upgrade for a few years and everything is night and day better. Amazon makes this experience terrible though. They lock your sim so you can only buy cards from them. I canceled prime and can no longer buy this card and the ONLY way around it is to buy another sim. So in review, IPhone 13 is great and worth the upgrade if you are a few generations behind. Amazon on the other hand should not be playing middle man and has made the experience terrible.

There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length.""This part of the product description is entirely inaccurate. There are visible imperfections when held at arm's length, most noticeably damage to the steel in the bottom left corner near the screen. There is also slight damage around the camera lenses, although this is not readily visible at arm's length.In addition to the visible damage, the button on the righthand side functions, but does not have the full range of travel that a new or like new phone has (I'm comparing directly to another iPhone 13 Pro Max I bought new). It's hard to sense sometimes whether you've pressed the button or not.Setting up the phone was an all-day, all-night, into the next day nightmare with it attempting to update to iOS 17.1 during the install process and failing multiple times during setup. It was on 3 month old software (iOS 16.5.1 (c). Once I finally managed to get it updated to iOS 17.1, I was able to wipe it (for the 4th or 5th time?) and then go through a normal setup process. I wish it had come with a more recent software version, that would have made setup easier.Battery life is excellent, its battery health is at 90%, which is exactly what I was hoping for with this purchase.All told, I'm pleased with the phone despite its imperfections, but in light of the imperfections and the age of the device, it was far more expensive than it should have been.

Had I seen the phone ahead of time and handled it, I would not have paid so much for it.""There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length. There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length.""This part of the product description is entirely inaccurate. There are visible imperfections when held at arm's length, most noticeably damage to the steel in the bottom left corner near the screen. There is also slight damage around the camera lenses, although this is not readily visible at arm's length.In addition to the visible damage, the button on the righthand side functions, but does not have the full range of travel that a new or like new phone has (I'm comparing directly to another iPhone 13 Pro Max I bought new). It's hard to sense sometimes whether you've pressed the button or not.Setting up the phone was an all-day, all-night, into the next day nightmare with it attempting to update to iOS 17.1 during the install process and failing multiple times during setup. It was on 3 month old software (iOS 16.5.1 (c). Once I finally managed to get it updated to iOS 17.1, I was able to wipe it (for the 4th or 5th time?) and then go through a normal setup process. I wish it had come with a more recent software version, that would have made setup easier.Battery life is excellent, its battery health is at 90%, which is exactly what I was hoping for with this purchase.All told, I'm pleased with the phone despite its imperfections, but in light of the imperfections and the age of the device, it was far more expensive than it should have been.

I received it within three days of my order and first thing i checked was the exterior.  Happy to say no blemishes and the screen looked original.  Case was pretty new looking and the phone powered up without issue, fully cleared and ready to load my data.  No smudging or cracks or side chips, and the clarity is what id expect of this caliber phone.  The battery was at 93% (score!) and managed to transfer all of my old phone over without issue.  Immediately put it in a lifeproof case cause i think this will be with me for the next three years!!  Hopefully this seller is still in business when Im ready for the next upgrade!

Had I seen the phone ahead of time and handled it, I would not have paid so much for it.""There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length. There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length.""This part of the product description is entirely inaccurate. There are visible imperfections when held at arm's length, most noticeably damage to the steel in the bottom left corner near the screen. There is also slight damage around the camera lenses, although this is not readily visible at arm's length.In addition to the visible damage, the button on the righthand side functions, but does not have the full range of travel that a new or like new phone has (I'm comparing directly to another iPhone 13 Pro Max I bought new). It's hard to sense sometimes whether you've pressed the button or not.Setting up the phone was an all-day, all-night, into the next day nightmare with it attempting to update to iOS 17.1 during the install process and failing multiple times during setup. It was on 3 month old software (iOS 16.5.1 (c). Once I finally managed to get it updated to iOS 17.1, I was able to wipe it (for the 4th or 5th time?) and then go through a normal setup process. I wish it had come with a more recent software version, that would have made setup easier.Battery life is excellent, its battery health is at 90%, which is exactly what I was hoping for with this purchase.All told, I'm pleased with the phone despite its imperfections, but in light of the imperfections and the age of the device, it was far more expensive than it should have been.

Case was pretty new looking and the phone powered up without issue, fully cleared and ready to load my data.  No smudging or cracks or side chips, and the clarity is what id expect of this caliber phone.  The battery was at 93% (score!) and managed to transfer all of my old phone over without issue.  Immediately put it in a lifeproof case cause i think this will be with me for the next three years!!  Hopefully this seller is still in business when Im ready for the next upgrade!

That's it.Phone does not have dial number auto-fill. (girl at store said 'that wpould be good!). Good is what android has had since day One/10 years  ago.If you go to another mode while on a call, and back to phone you get the white dial screen with no chance to hang up.You have to go to past screens, and choose the black one you're on when on a call with the red hang-up button.The phone doesn't know you're on a call !How do you get back to that screen.? 'Simple'/'intuitive,' you just scroll your finger an inch up from the base of the phone to see past screens. This gesture is obvious. NOT.The camera is good in close-up mode but otherwise an disastrous low res blur at landscape distance. I can't even post a picture on FB it's so blurry, even 4"" square.RETURN.

Good is what android has had since day One/10 years  ago.If you go to another mode while on a call, and back to phone you get the white dial screen with no chance to hang up.You have to go to past screens, and choose the black one you're on when on a call with the red hang-up button.The phone doesn't know you're on a call !How do you get back to that screen.? 'Simple'/'intuitive,' you just scroll your finger an inch up from the base of the phone to see past screens. This gesture is obvious.

Itvwas easy to transfer all my data onto. I thought i was going to go to my provider to have it unlocked but i didnt! Overall, the phone is great, the screen display is amazing, (great for watching movies) the camera kinda dragged, (meaning when u moved the camera to the left it would move like in slow motion but it was). Its a great phone and would definitley buy again or buy from amazon. It even came in a cute white box saying “amazon renewed” ! The battery on the phone last a long time and the phone is bright even whenu turn it down. I highly recommend buying this iphone!

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

When I looked at the reviews, most of the complaints were about minor issues like small scratches or the charger not being original. However, I decided to go for it since it was a premium refurbished item, and some reviews mentioned that they had good experiences with battery conditions of 98% or higher, with only the occasional replaced part.I went ahead and ordered it, and it turned out to be one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches at all, and only 25 charge cycles, meaning the battery is practically at 100%. I connected it to Utool, and it gave me a score of 100, showing that all the parts are original. It feels like a brand-new phone, as if I just took it out of its original box. I would definitely buy another premium refurbished iPhone in the future.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

When I looked at the reviews, most of the complaints were about minor issues like small scratches or the charger not being original. However, I decided to go for it since it was a premium refurbished item, and some reviews mentioned that they had good experiences with battery conditions of 98% or higher, with only the occasional replaced part.I went ahead and ordered it, and it turned out to be one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches at all, and only 25 charge cycles, meaning the battery is practically at 100%. I connected it to Utool, and it gave me a score of 100, showing that all the parts are original. It feels like a brand-new phone, as if I just took it out of its original box. I would definitely buy another premium refurbished iPhone in the future.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

When I looked at the reviews, most of the complaints were about minor issues like small scratches or the charger not being original. However, I decided to go for it since it was a premium refurbished item, and some reviews mentioned that they had good experiences with battery conditions of 98% or higher, with only the occasional replaced part.I went ahead and ordered it, and it turned out to be one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches at all, and only 25 charge cycles, meaning the battery is practically at 100%. I connected it to Utool, and it gave me a score of 100, showing that all the parts are original. It feels like a brand-new phone, as if I just took it out of its original box. I would definitely buy another premium refurbished iPhone in the future.

I've had great experiences with multiple iPhones.

They are not a good insurance company (once again, don't take my word for it, search AIG is a terrible company and you'll get endless stories about the terrible workplace culture, how they helped trigger the great recession, and how they lie/cheat/steal on things like iPhone theft & loss).While there are plenty of stories out there for your reading displeasure, I'll recount my daughter's - which is identical to thousands of others. She had her phone stolen while out at a bar. She realized within moments that it was gone, so she used another device for Find My Phone and saw that it was already on moving away from her location. She immediately contacted Apple and they told her to follow their recommended steps in case of theft, which includes locking the phone.

It was denied because AIG requires that Find My Phone be on for the ""entirety of the claims process."" So, her insurance was ""voided"" by the thief doing what they usually do - turning off the phone so that the actual owner can't find it. Same will almost certainly happen if you drop it in a lake or have it run out of juice after being misplaced.Buying theft & loss coverage from Apple is literally just giving AIG money for something they most likely won't honor. Sure, it's only a few bucks a month, but if you're going to throw money away, do it on something less frustrating.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

However, I decided to go for it since it was a premium refurbished item, and some reviews mentioned that they had good experiences with battery conditions of 98% or higher, with only the occasional replaced part.I went ahead and ordered it, and it turned out to be one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches at all, and only 25 charge cycles, meaning the battery is practically at 100%. I connected it to Utool, and it gave me a score of 100, showing that all the parts are original. It feels like a brand-new phone, as if I just took it out of its original box. I would definitely buy another premium refurbished iPhone in the future.

From the start, the phone constantly rebooted on its own. I took it to the Apple Store, and the Genius Bar ran a diagnosis. They told me the phone’s logic board was malfunctioning, which was a serious issue.Because of this, I had no choice but to return the phone. While I appreciate the option to buy renewed products, this one unfortunately didn’t meet expectations. I hope future customers have a better experience, but I can’t recommend this particular item.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT.

From the start, the phone constantly rebooted on its own. I took it to the Apple Store, and the Genius Bar ran a diagnosis. They told me the phone’s logic board was malfunctioning, which was a serious issue.Because of this, I had no choice but to return the phone. While I appreciate the option to buy renewed products, this one unfortunately didn’t meet expectations. I hope future customers have a better experience, but I can’t recommend this particular item.

I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I was hoping that this iPhone 15 Pro Max would be in excellent condition also but to my surprise this one was a bit worse. First the frame around the phone has some deep scratches that are visible from 12 inches away. The screen looks alright with one small deep scratch and is still visible even with the screen protector on. The back glass is flawless and no scratches including the cameras.I am satisfied with the battery health at 100% 84 Cycles. Although I don’t feel this was worth the price, if your spending around 1k for this for excellent quality, i expect it to be near flawless. I had high expectations but I guess you just have to be lucky with what you get.

My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I was hoping that this iPhone 15 Pro Max would be in excellent condition also but to my surprise this one was a bit worse. First the frame around the phone has some deep scratches that are visible from 12 inches away. The screen looks alright with one small deep scratch and is still visible even with the screen protector on. The back glass is flawless and no scratches including the cameras.I am satisfied with the battery health at 100% 84 Cycles. Although I don’t feel this was worth the price, if your spending around 1k for this for excellent quality, i expect it to be near flawless. I had high expectations but I guess you just have to be lucky with what you get.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

When I looked at the reviews, most of the complaints were about minor issues like small scratches or the charger not being original. However, I decided to go for it since it was a premium refurbished item, and some reviews mentioned that they had good experiences with battery conditions of 98% or higher, with only the occasional replaced part.I went ahead and ordered it, and it turned out to be one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches at all, and only 25 charge cycles, meaning the battery is practically at 100%. I connected it to Utool, and it gave me a score of 100, showing that all the parts are original. It feels like a brand-new phone, as if I just took it out of its original box. I would definitely buy another premium refurbished iPhone in the future.

I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15. I'm GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel we're wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. We're on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. Our experience was great 💯.

When I looked at the reviews, most of the complaints were about minor issues like small scratches or the charger not being original. However, I decided to go for it since it was a premium refurbished item, and some reviews mentioned that they had good experiences with battery conditions of 98% or higher, with only the occasional replaced part.I went ahead and ordered it, and it turned out to be one of the smartest purchases I’ve made. The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches at all, and only 25 charge cycles, meaning the battery is practically at 100%. I connected it to Utool, and it gave me a score of 100, showing that all the parts are original. It feels like a brand-new phone, as if I just took it out of its original box. I would definitely buy another premium refurbished iPhone in the future.

I’ve seen some bad reviews when it comes to buying Amazon certified refurbished however, this was an excellent value for the money as the phone was basically brand new.

I was hoping that this iPhone 15 Pro Max would be in excellent condition also but to my surprise this one was a bit worse. First the frame around the phone has some deep scratches that are visible from 12 inches away. The screen looks alright with one small deep scratch and is still visible even with the screen protector on. The back glass is flawless and no scratches including the cameras.I am satisfied with the battery health at 100% 84 Cycles. Although I don’t feel this was worth the price, if your spending around 1k for this for excellent quality, i expect it to be near flawless. I had high expectations but I guess you just have to be lucky with what you get.

I’ll list the pros and cons below.Pros:98% batteryNo scratches on screenCons:Scratches and chips around camera rings and body.Phone is glitchy.  My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weirdI did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software.  I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.

I’ve had no issues at all. It came with a charger and was all packaged very well. It was super easy to transfer everything on my old iPhone to this one, and then to transfer service using eSIM. I received advance communication from the seller about how to contact them if there is any problem with the phone, which was reassuring.

I highly recommend making sure you buy directly from them as a seller on the listing not just from amazon.com, or another seller.

I really wanted this model and I didn’t want to be tied to a carrier. The phone is beautiful - scratch-free, looks brand new, battery charges fully and lasts a very long time. I’ve had no issues at all. It came with a charger and was all packaged very well. It was super easy to transfer everything on my old iPhone to this one, and then to transfer service using eSIM. I received advance communication from the seller about how to contact them if there is any problem with the phone, which was reassuring. I’m very happy with this purchase, the seller, and the phone itself.

When returning it to Amazon,  i received a refund notice showing a RESTOCKING fee of $461.41.  The refund received was 1/2 of what we paid for the phone.
