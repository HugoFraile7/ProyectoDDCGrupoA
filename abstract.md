
We have a dataset named Amazon_Cell_Phones.csv, whose contents are
described in the metadata_grupoA.md file. This dataset contains over
3,000 rows and 19 columns of data related to mobile phone sales on the
Amazon platform. We will proceed to extract only the data concerning
mobile phones from the Apple brand.

Using web scraping techniques, we will extend the data we currently
have. We will add several user reviews that include ratings and comments
regarding these models. These reviews will add two columns of
unstructured data to our dataset: one containing the review text left by
the user and the other with the review date. With this information, we
aim to prove or disprove the following hypothesis:Apple mobile phones tend to receive worse ratings over
time, as more issues are discovered the longer they are on the market.
