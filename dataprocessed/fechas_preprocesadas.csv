2,iPhone XR,168.39,64,"the exterior is in perfect condition and so far it’s operating like my previous one iphone xr. i had accidentally ordered the one that was only 2g (which no one should want) and the seller responded and my cancellation was approved and i got the phone a day earlier. this phone has 4g.the battery: i tested this one. i got 8.2 hours from 100% to 3% with it in low mode purposely doing battery-sucking things such as downloading all my apps while a long update was happening, watching videos, syncing stuff from icloud such as photos, playing a game, etc. the phone was a bit warm and working hard. they guarantee that it will be at least at 80% capacity and some people are lucky to get more. mine came at 79% which is not a big deal and i just can’t be without a phone.80% isn’t terrible unless you constantly are doing battery sucking things. don’t fret. my previous one was four or five years old and was at 80% before it got destroyed. they say you lose 1% a month. not mine because i did battery saving things. at home i would plug it in since i watch battery-sucking things like long yt videos. often i keep it in low mode and the screen turns off quickly-i have to put in my lock screen password a lot which is annoying but it saves usage. when i charge it i practically turn off the light. turn off background refresh on apps that aren’t that important to be refreshed. keep your screen brightness as dim as you can handle. i think using it in airplane mode helps. i keep location services off until an app needs it. if you put it on never so you don’t have to keep tapping the screen, that seriously sucks up the battery. if you take lots of photos and videos, say on vacation, you might want to bring an external battery charger. limit your notifications on your lock screen because all that lighting up sucks your battery. look at your battery health to see what you’re doing.80% isn’t bad. it depends what you do on it and how you set your screen.

3,iPhone XR,168.39,64,"i have had this product for a few years and it still runs well enough to keep for now. please be aware that the ""crack"" seen on the front of the phone was not there upon arrival, that is in fact a slightly cracked screen cover i installed personally after purchasing.the apple iphone xr, 64gb, black (renewed) is an excellent choice for those looking to get a high-quality iphone without breaking the bank. as a renewed product, it offers great functionality and performance, making it a worthwhile investment.performance and quality:the iphone xr performs impressively well. the a12 bionic chip ensures smooth operation, and the battery life is commendable. the 6.1-inch liquid retina display is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for media consumption and everyday use. despite being a renewed product, it functions just as efficiently as a brand-new phone.value for money:at this price point, the iphone xr is a fantastic deal. you get all the features and capabilities of an iphone without the premium price tag of a brand-new model. for those on a budget, this unlocked version provides flexibility and the freedom to choose your carrier.condition:however, it’s important to note that the phone does come with some visible wear and tear. while these cosmetic imperfections do not affect the device's performance, they are noticeable. for instance, there might be minor scratches or scuffs on the screen and body. this is expected with a renewed product, but it’s something potential buyers should be aware of.overall:overall, the apple iphone xr, 64gb, black (unlocked) (renewed) is a solid purchase. it delivers high performance and quality at a reduced cost, making it an excellent value. while it’s not perfect due to visible wear and tear, it’s a small trade-off for the significant savings and the ability to own a high-functioning iphone. i would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get the most out of their money.

7,iPhone 11,230.0,64,"i honestly can’t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iphone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! i would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! but read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.my oldest daughter dropped her iphone xr in the toilet and it completely died. this seller had the best priced renewed iphone i found with next day delivery and good reviews, so i purchased the phone. it was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so i was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.the phone was sent via ups, which i didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like amazon and usps do. not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! but that’s an issue with ups, not the seller.when we opened the package i was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. one thing i wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. i worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but i was wrong. after charging for a bit i checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! i was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone i noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so i reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.the seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when i reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. i asked them if i could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as i took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! this took place on a friday and i didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so i told them i’d reach out monday for the shipping label and that i had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when i got it so i’d be sending it back with it on.life got hectic and i didn’t reach out until thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. when trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so i missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go friday morning instead.i went to the post office and all was well until i mentioned that there was a phone in the package when i asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so i needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. when i told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but i chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery was brand new, and i didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since i don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. i took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.when i got back to the car i sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! of course there were issues with ups again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until monday, but thankfully it arrived on saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).when i opened the replacement package and inspected the phone i was shocked! i thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked brand new! there wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! it’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. i checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! i tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!i also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info i was looking for!between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, i won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! this was honestly the best experience i've ever had with a seller/replacement item on amazon in the 15+ years i've used the site!

8,iPhone 11,230.0,64,"okay, it came in a weird packaging so i was suspicious it was absolutely wonderfully packed tho. it came in a small box, iphone in bubble wrap and then a lighting cable to charge in a plastic bag. the screen had no scratches, the back was wonderfully brand new, i chose yellow . it looked flawless all around. brightness is also very very significant and good. it’s very bright . memory capacity i went with 64 gigabytes and there’s 54 left i believe . the battery life was at 100% for me which is wonderful, i diagnosed the phone and nothing was wrong with it, also the speaker quality was absolutely wonderful. everything about this device so far was so flawless and wonderful. i bought this for my mother and she’s so happy with this gift . it also arrived very fast, it had came two days before the arrival date and that was a wonderful experience too. other than that, the phone is very quick with everything . it responds very quick and doesn’t have any freezes or lags either . anyone who wants a backup phone, extra phone or a good gift for someone. i highly recommend this purchase! i am not a big reviewer and nor do i type but this is worth to help others make the best decision i’ve made. seems very unrealistic with the price but it’s very legit .

10,iPhone 11,230.0,64,"i recently purchased the iphone 11 256gb renewed, and overall, i’m quite satisfied with my purchase. here are my thoughts:pros:great value: for a renewed phone, it offers excellent value. the price is significantly lower than a brand-new model, yet it performs almost as well.battery health: the battery health was at 90% when i received it, which is impressive for a renewed device.camera quality: the camera is fantastic, capturing clear and vibrant photos. it’s perfect for everyday photography.storage capacity: with 256gb of storage, i have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.cons:minor scratches: there were a few minor scratches on the back, but nothing too noticeable or affecting functionality.accessories: the phone came with a generic charger and cable, which work fine but aren’t as high-quality as the original apple accessories.echo issue: occasionally, there’s a slight echo during calls, but it’s not a deal-breaker for me.overall: if you’re looking for a budget-friendly iphone with ample storage and great performance, the iphone 11 256gb renewed is a solid choice. just be prepared for a few minor imperfections that come with a renewed product.

11,iPhone 11,230.0,64,"my son's been wanting a iphone for a long time. he's 17 years old and worked over the summer to buy it. i'm so proud of him. i'm happy that he also bought a refurbished phone so he can get the same type of phone he wants at a great price. there were no scratches or any damage to the phone. the battery life seems to last him from when he wakes up until he gets home from football practice. i think he does charge it at school though. so maybe the battery life is not the best. but it works great for him right now.

16,iPhone 12,287.0,64,"for starters; the price on these phones is great. between having the reassurance of amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.i needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.i hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. and i was good with that. needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. i was on my own this time.okay.... that’s not entirely true. my grandma had an iphone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. going from an iphone 11 pro max to an iphone 7 was….bad. it was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! i needed an upgrade. fast. my 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. and that’s on me. they had my old xr (formerly my dad’s)i scoured fb marketplace. i’d decided upgrade a little, so i could feel better about the switch.  i didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. i would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.marketplace had plenty.  sending message after message from my iphone 7, i worried. “this person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “i want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “battery life? errr last time i checked it was like 74%?….no, i can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” etc.so much pressure. what happens if the thing doesn’t work? that’s $300+ down the drain. i knew i couldn’t afford new. but i hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on facebook. i didn’t want to get scammed, and i also didn’t want to settle.that’s when i remembered good ol’ amazon. maybe i’d check there. just for funsies. probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” mostly same cost or less than what i’d found so far. surely there was a catch? i read through everything, tested by amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, i can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. and i could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! with a warranty?!!i recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. the lavender would take an extra day to arrive. mint it was!! as promised, it arrived the next day. it was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. all for less than i would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”once my case and screen protector arrived i excitedly set it up and synced my data.oh no.the face id didnt work 😭after becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  i was desperate for the convenience of face id. i had been using my fingerprint. like a *caveman*.not to mention i have blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. idk if that’s true, but i needed face id!!i googled, i contacted apple support. fixing it could be upwards of $300. that’s almost what i paid for the whole phone!!i realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. but i also wanted one fully functioning.so i reached out to amazon support and explained. the rep was incredibly helpful (as most amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “if they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.i’m ngl. i was nervous. i didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on amazon in the past. at least amazon had my back, ig. the concert wasn’t till july. even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. i could make do in the meantime.the seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. they responded within minutes. they were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.as i’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. i explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.i could deal with one day without a phone! i gratefully accepted. that was saturday night, we made plans to catch up monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.monday i reached back out; and they were ready to ship, but they *had no more green….* 🫢 shock“…do you have purple”no. :( just blue, white, and black.this was a huge bummer.it’s silly i know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but i mean…. my change of heart about this whole phone thing hinged on the fun colour. without it, i was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while i was watching youtube while washing dishes. i needed a cool colour. plus,  i’d already gotten the matching case! clear with mint green borders.it wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. it was pretty and classy, but i wanted something fun. i even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,they told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. still, no greens or purples came in.ugh. reality was setting in. i was going to have to settle. it was fine, i thought. at least it would be a fully functioning phone.no. i wasn’t ready to let go. they assured me i could take my time to decide, and i asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. if it didn’t, *then* i would choose from the options available.i messaged them wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. they got in purple! yay.they sent a label, i dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! i’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. i didn’t even have my new case yet 😅despite the barney-esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is gorgeous and i’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end i’m glad i ended up with the lavender. i was overjoyed when i was prompted to set face id during setup. worked brilliantly, as did everything else.great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… its purple!can’t wait to pair it with the new case. i’m so glad i went this route where i have some peace of mind as a buyer.i’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as i must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceif you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. you receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

 i broke the screen of my iphone x and got some cracks on the back. initially, i planned to repair it at the apple store, but just fixing the screen would have cost me $275 plus taxes (as of 8/7/2024). so, i decided to buy a renewed phone on amazon. i was a bit worried about the purchase until i received the phone. when i unboxed it, i was really amazed. there were no signs that this phone was renewed—no scratches, no fingerprints, and no unpleasant smell. it seemed too good to be true. i checked the battery's maximum capacity, and it was at 98%. some might say this number could be inaccurate, but here's my experience: the next day, i had a chance to test it. i had back-to-back teams meetings in the first half of the day and had to use phone to talk and view my supervisor’s screen while validating data on my side. the phone performed very well. i had no concerns about signal, battery, or sound quality. everything worked perfectly. additionally, the phone came with a screen protector, which was a nice touch.i highly recommend mobilesupply to anyone looking for a quality products. their product exceeded my expectations, and i couldn't be happier with my purchase. the phone looks and functions like new, offering excellent value for the price.

26,iPhone XS,182.0,64,"i received the phone within 2 days of ordering. the packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. however, i checked the battery health on the first day which stated “important battery message: your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”  the maximum capacity for the battery was 78%. no problem, i thought, because one of the reason’s i bought from amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “guaranteed by amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “well clearly, i was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. so, i called amazon customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. i did this on the same day i received the phone. the representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  he also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”  that way, i would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.the day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, i called amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. much to my surprise, i was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. this irritated me for two reasons: (1) i had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had i not called amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) i was specifically told by amazon customer service that i did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.i told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. when it became clear that she would not be able to help me, i asked to speak with her manager. after providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. that phone call never happened.the following day i called amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. i explained the steps i had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”  when i asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. i told her that of course it was legit, as i had email documentation regarding the entire process!after being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. she also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. i asked her to clarify that i would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions i had previously received via email. she looked up that email and saw it said: “please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”  after reading that she placed me on hold again.after a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. i asked why. she said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. when she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” i should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  i reiterated that this was unacceptable and that i had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as amazon had told me to do. i wanted the replacement sent first before i returned the defective phone. she said the email i received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. i told her that while i understand that people make mistakes, i did not think i should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that amazon made. she apologized for the mistake but made it clear that i would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. i informed her i would be writing a negative review.to summarize: i was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. one star.

34,iPhone 11 Pro Max,329.0,64,"update (12/17/23): additional observations: 1) the amazon renewed certification card is marked 10/27/23, and when i received it 12/2/23 (about 5 weeks), the battery was completely dead; 2) after charging back to 100%, i put it in airplane mode (to turn off both wifi and bluetooth), and also put it in battery saver mode; i checked the battery percentages once a day, and it was losing 10-15% per day, so this battery is very weak. i did a parallel test with another iphone (11 pro max), and that one only lost 10% (100% > 90%) over a week. this is an excellent test to check the true condition of the battery.update (12/15/23): ordered a 5th amazon premium renewed phone (iphone 12 pro max), and the battery life, which should be above 90%, is actually 88%.update (3/28/23): after lengthy discussions with amazon, they will not honor the 90% battery guarantee stated on the amazon premium renewed page, because it is ""not stated on the amazon invoice"". 1-star, no longer recommended.update (2/1/23): ran into some issues, probably things that should be checked upon receipt of a renewed or premium renewed product: 1) battery life [below advertised 80 or 90%], 2) parts replaced, either with genuine or non-genuine apple parts, 3) overall functionality [defective charging port]. reducing overall rating to 4-stars.summary: upgrading from an iphone 7 plus, and decided i would go with the 11 pro max version. i was on the fence whether the extra money for the premium renewed is worth it, so will be discussing what i considered.observations: the high level basic differences are: 1) about a $100 difference; 2) three vs. 12 months return period: 3) battery level of 80% vs. 90%.recommendation: after considering the factors, i decided to look into how much a replacement battery would cost, which is $40 right now. however, starting with the iphone 8 (i think), apple started sealing the cases, which requires a heat gun to separate the case because of the extra waterproofing adhesive. to breakdown the addition $100 cost, subtract the $40 battery from that, leaving $60 for an additional 9-months (or $6.67/month) to ""insurance"" to return the phone if issues come up.carrier lock: i decided i wanted an unlocked version, and that appears to be another feature that is included with premium renewed, with the majority of carrier locked versions being offered as renewed only.conclusion: for the additional $100, i elected to go with the renewed premium. i rate both the renewed and the premium renewed as 5-stars. which you chose would depend on individual financial and personal factors.related products:apple iphone 11 pro max, us version, 256gb, midnight - unlocked (renewed)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsprice: $491.86https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b07z4681lq/apple iphone 11 pro max, 256gb, midnight green - unlocked (renewed premium)4.3 out of 5 stars  12,122 ratings | 1000+ answered questionsprice: $586.00https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b08bhfgjxf

37,iPhone XS Max,234.95,64,"6 months later update - still acts like i bought it yesterday. everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues i know of whatsoever. still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (original review is below.)first off, i would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. i was very hesitant with this one. but amazon has a wonderful return policy so i thought, if it isn't what i'm expecting, i can always return it.the things i was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iphone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as i ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine apple product in the first place!upon opening it, i did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. of course, this is to be expected. i'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. the stainless steel band is spotless.i powered it on, it greeted me with apple's famous multilingual 'hello' screen. and thankfully the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. i set it up with my apple id and went straight to settings. i checked the serial number at apple's website. and was so happy that what i received was a 100% genuine xs max. i was also very happy to discover that the storage was what i ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. i also checked the battery health which is at 98%. leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.everything checks out, i am thrilled! coming from an iphone 8 plus, i notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. but the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. and have i mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? i'm really happy i chose the xs max over the 11 pro max. mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.being a huge fan of touch id, i was very upset about having to switch to face id. but honestly, it's actually a lot better than i expected it to be. its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.now, performance. this phone excels at pretty much all that i ask it to. games are faster and smoother than i've ever experienced on a mobile device. (even the note 9 i had.) and the new oled super retina display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. the blacks are so dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. the camera is unbelievable too. photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.so overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. i am very happy with it! just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like i did.

61,iPhone 12 Pro,379.74,128,"buying a used phone can be an anxiety filled experience - you read the reviews and hope that you're one of the happy customers and are lucky enough to get an ""as advertised product."" you have to take a chance. i did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. the phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.the challenge of course is you have a new phone -  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. so, i'm happy for a few days and then one evening i discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. a panic search online revealed apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by apple - crap!i went to a repair shop the next day, they ran apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for apple parts - they're not familiar with the apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.no i'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the apple diagnostic through the serial number - they offer $25 refund if i'll keep the phone.  - so this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. i chose to believe the latter. and accepted their offer.and here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while i might think i hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. so for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if i have to get it repaired - i took a chance -i say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - i typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - at&t typically had new old stock and i took advantage of that, but i have a grandfathered  plan that they no longer make good money on, so i'm no longer eligible for that.hope your experience is a good one - all the best, don

62,iPhone 12 Pro,379.74,128,"on my journey of ordering a refurbished iphone and it can be a journey this was an excellent purchase.  screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly.  charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp.  battery health is 88% and stable.  got same day delivery and up and running quickly.  purchased refurb level was “excellent”.  should have been my first stop..now i did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone. i purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.  refurb level was “premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware.  so in the return box this goes.many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens.  some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair.  so be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers.  i personally will not accept it and if i’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone i expect it to be repaired with genuine iphone parts.  not to mention i don’t appreciate caution notifications every time i go into my settings.again the phone i received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped.  the other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up.  if it is not! do not connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.

63,iPhone 12 Pro,379.74,128,"i got the iphone 12 pro with amazon’s “renewed - premium” option. the brand was “hybridit”. just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do i have a few concerns.my biggest concern is with the packaging. the phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). you can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. luckily i didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. the smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). i was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with amazon’s highest option.otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. i’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.keep in mind, i’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with amazon renewed or hybridit. however, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.hope this helps!

81,iPhone 13 Pro,509.99,128,"i purchased this phone as an upgrade for myself as i desperately needed it, i saw mixed reviews on battery life but overall the conditions of the phones seemed to be good. when mine arrived i was very pleasantly surprised when it looked like it was in perfect condition, there wasn’t a single scratch dent scuff or anything of the like on this phone (trust me i looked everywhere) the phone was clean with no fingerprints and not even dust in the speakers. i later checked the battery condition and saw that it was at a perfect 100%. the phone i got must have been leftover stock never sold from apple, and at the price point of nearly half of the msrp of this phone when it originally released, i was extremely happy. there were 2 things that decreased my experience ever so slightly. 1: the packaging, it was pretty cheap and poor packaging and didn’t look appealing but it protected the phone and that’s what’s important ( it also came with sim ejector tool) 2: the setup process for the phone, i struggled for 3 hours to get the phone to set up properly, for some reason it would keep getting stuck and i would have to restart and reinstall all updates for the phone, it wouldn’t download my apple id or sync my stuff from my old phone, but eventually i came back the next day to try again and it ended up working, not sure what i did differently to fix this issue but none the less the phone ended up working perfectly in the end. one side note: i don’t believe this was a fault of the seller i think this was an apple issue! after all, i got a brand new iphone 13 pro and i am extremely happy and satisfied with this purchase

83,iPhone 13 Pro,509.99,128,"as soon as i took the phone out of the box, it looked brand new, which was impressive right away. the exterior was clean, and the sides were spotless, except for a bit of dirt on the silencer and in the speakers, but nothing too concerning. the screen did have some minor scratches that were noticeable without a screen protector, but once the protector was on, they were hardly visible.the phone has the right amount of storage, exactly what i needed. the battery health is at 83%, which isn’t perfect but still acceptable for my usage. i was a bit disappointed when i realized my box didn’t come with a sim card pin, especially after seeing other reviews mention it. all i received was the phone and a charger. unfortunately, the charger was subpar, it has a shortage and is not a lightning charger. thankfully, i had an extra charger on hand, so this issue wasn’t a dealbreaker for me.one small issue i’ve noticed is that the microphone seems to be a bit low when recording voice messages, so i find myself needing to speak louder than usual. however, the overall quality of the phone is good, and i haven’t encountered any major problems yet.i feel like this phone was a good value for the money. despite the minor dirt and the low microphone volume, it came in excellent condition. setting up the phone was easy, especially since i was moving from android to iphone. the face id works perfectly, and the regular passcode option adds extra security.i was initially worried about the camera quality since the phone is renewed, but i was pleasantly surprised, the camera quality is amazing. so far, so good!

90,iPhone 13 mini,364.0,128,"tldr: first one i got was horrendous, but seller communication was exceptional, quick, no hassle, and replacement was awesome!this is a review for the seller 'hybrid it', not the actual iphone 13 mini. there are plenty of those already.i bought an 'acceptable condition' 13 mini, as i don't mind scratches and dents if it'll save a few hundred bucks. i bought from 'hybrid it' because they had like 99% positive ratings and i know refurbished can be hit and miss. and they had prime shipping.the one they sent was terrible. the screen was a fake lcd knockoff, the battery health was at 77%, and it was full of scratches on the screen. far below my already low expectations.i messaged them and they offered me these options:1) replacement,2) return for full refund, or3) to refund the cost of replacing the battery at apple (which is like a third of the cost of the phone itself)they answer surprisingly quickly every time. literally within a few minutes during the day and within a few hours at night. ____ing impressive! i needed a phone quick so we decided the best option was to buy another one (also 'acceptable', same price), and return the old one for a refund, and they would make sure to send a better one the second time.it definitely exceeded my expectations. almost perfect condition, 98% battery, no scratches basically. i think it was a fair outcome/settlement for wasting my time with an insultingly bad one the first time. i would've been fine with 'acceptable' condition but the first one i got was not even up to par with amazon's standards.i'm really happy with the second one and how they handle customer service. thanks hybrid it!!! oh, and this isn't a fake review! a happy customer, crazy right???

91,iPhone 13 mini,364.0,128,"i was on a waiting list for a 'renewed premium'. seemed to be a long waiting list. i finally gave up and went with a 'renewed' advertised in excellent condition. given amazon's generous return policy, returning it would have been easy if there had been issues. i probably wouldn't have tried this with an online retailer other than amazon or apple.the supplier was techmint, amazon was only the purchase portal. there seems to be a number of 'amazon-qualified suppliers' involved. to know who you're buying from, the 'ships from/sold by' info. is on the right side of the product page. there may also be differences in packaging and accessories. best to read through the advertising to know exactly what you're buying. or contact the supplier before purchasing. given that amazon backs these purchases, not a concern.it arrived without scratches, dings, or apparent wear. looks like new. that said, anyone buying a 'renewed' phone should expect varying degrees of condition within the parameters of amazon's advertising. i'd suggest buying a 'renewed premium' for your best chance of a like-new phone. i probably got lucky with a 'renewed'.it shipped in *very* well designed and protective box designed for phones. not likely to be damaged in transit short of extremely heavy crush damage. if you plan on shipping your phone or storing a back-up, i'd suggest keeping it. the box has spacers to accommodate different sizes. kudos to the packaging engineers that designed this. well done.it was delivered with 100% battery health which almost certainly means that the phone was opened up and the battery replaced. the likelihood of a 'renewed' 13 mini arriving with battery health at 100% is slim to none. i assume that they did this because the phone was traded in with < 80% battery health. the advertising states that the phone will arrive with battery health of ≥ 80%.i ran two diagnostics to check functions. in both cases, no issues. one of the diagnostics is built into ios. you'll need ios 17 or later and not a beta release. search for 'built in iphone diagnostic' for instructions. there's another which makes doing this quite a bit easier. from the apple app store search for 'phone doctor plus'. it leans more towards being a function check vs a more sophisticated diagnostic but great for making sure everything works. there's a free and paid version. there are others but these are the only two i've tried.alternatively, you can take it to an apple store and ask them to do it for you. your carrier may also have on-site diagnostic capability. best to call ahead and ask.the advertising stated that an mfi certified charging/data cable ships with the phone. mine shipped with a 3ft cloth jacketed usb c to lightning charging cable. no branding or print on the cable, no included documentation, no packaging. it appears similar to what you sometimes see without packaging and hanging from peg racks in convenience stores.i have no reason to believe that the provided cable isn't mfi certified and from a reliable manufacturer but without more information, i'd suggest using an apple product or something from a reliable aftermarket supplier such as anker or belkin. look for 'mfi certified' especially if you want fast charging capability. there are reasons usb c cables can be pricey, especially those designed for high power delivery. better safe than sorry.mine shipped without a charger. i checked the interior packaging to be sure. i'd say the same about a charger as i did about the cable - mfi certified and from a reputable manufacturer - apple, anker, belkin, etc. for the 13 mini, apple recommends a minimum of a 20 watt charger for optimal/fast charging. apple's is about 20 dollars. it's also what apple recommends for powering it's magsafe accessory.some suppliers advertise that a sim card removal tool is included. mine didn't. if yours shipped with a sim card (mine did not), i'd suggest reading through the pros and cons of sim vs esim. if esim meets your needs, i'd recommend removing the sim and switching to esim. switching to esim can be done in your phone's settings. no expertise or hardware required. although unlikely if buying from an 'amazon-qualified supplier' (i assume), sim cards can be compromised. if you need a sim card, best to get one from your carrier instead of a mystery sim.you'll need a case. without, it's not a matter of if you'll drop it but when. this is my second mini, the first an iphone 12 mini. slippery and with a smaller form factor than other iphones, very easy lose grip especially if you have large hands. further, without a case the camera lenses and screen make contact with whatever surface you place them on.the apple leather case has been my go-to for the last 3-4 iphones. very well designed, doesn't add significant bulk, no sharp edges and it slips into and out of a pocket easily. the drop protection has proven to be excellent. great case for all but extreme circumstances. they're relatively pricey so if you're looking to save, there are often amazon customer returns available at steeply discounted prices.the iphone 12 mini and 13 mini cases are not interchangeable. i tried. the camera lens housings are different. the 12 mini case will not fit the 13 mini. the 13 mini case will fit the 12 mini but there will be a gap on the right side of the lens housing.not to overstate it but if you're considering both the 12 mini and 13 mini, battery life may be problematic for heavy users. true of all phones but somewhat more so for a mini. if you have a full size phone with a larger battery at ≥ 90% battery health (guesstimate) and often find yourself scrambling to find a charger, the mini may not be for you.if you're on the move a lot without convenient charging options, a small magsafe power bank (≤ 5000mah) will bring some peace of mind and a lot of convenience. great when traveling. definitely stick with time tested manufacturers. anker and belkin sell a wide variety. note that the tsa only allows powerbanks in carry-ons.apple discontinued it's iphone powerbanks (magsafe battery pack). as of this writing, you can still find them new from third party sources such as walmart online. never buy used. there are confirmed and very convincing counterfeits out there so i'd be cautious about which supplier you choose.if you're looking at both the 12 and 13 minis, the 13 mini uses an a15 processor which is somewhat more energy efficient and slightly faster. it also has a slightly larger battery. there are other differences including an upgraded camera.compared to the 12 mini, i found the differences to be almost insignificant in day to day use. having a ~10% larger battery is nice but given my usage habits, rarely something that makes a difference. long term, the 13 mini will receive system updates from apple for about a year longer. this may be the most value added difference.there are a lot of comparison reviews. worth checking out before buying. search for ""iphone 13 mini vs iphone 12 mini"".happy customer. i'm fully committed to the mini form factor/dimensions. i carry it all day in a front or back pocket and barely know it's there. when i need to replace it, perhaps mini's will be back in the menu from apple. hope so.

109,iPhone 14 Pro Max,726.05,128,"overview: i bought the iphone 14 pro max as my first iphone coming from android because i wanted to try it out, and it works well! i brought it to my carrier to transfer phones numbers, had some trouble setting it up at first but i figured it out on my own, which can be disheartening to some but here’s the pros and cons.pros:-cosmetically great | saw no huge scratches or marks on the phone, if so, they’re probably really minor.-pre-installed screen protector | the seller i bought it from was called “gsmforall” it was nice of them to do it for me instead of doing myself, which i wouldn’t have minded but it was awesome of them to include that in!-safe packaging |  phone came in bubble rap sleeve when i opened it, can be considered standard but i liked that they included it.battery life | battery works just fine, charges up to 100% easily.cons:-cheap charging chord | cheap lightning charger, the box it fine but the charger head was loose 3rd day into using it, i would recommend getting an actual apple branded lighting chord or a braided one from a third party seller.-trouble registering for icloud account | this only really applies if you’re a first time apple user (like me) and needs to create an icloud account, took it to my carrier to transfer numbers which they did just fine, but i had to call apple support at home to troubleshoot the problem with a message displaying that i could not verify my phone number, had to erase my safari history. the process can be troublesome for people who may not know what to do if they come across it.overall, owning an iphone for the first time has been a great experience, i was debating on getting the s24 ultra from samsung because i’ve already owned one. but i can say i’m happy owning an iphone! :)

111,iPhone 14 Pro Max,726.05,128,"tl;dr version: buy from the amazon renewed store at your own risk. if amazon sends you the wrong phone by mistake, expect at least two hours with support to get it resolved.it sucks to have to write a negative review about a bad experience with amazon, but this is the world we live in. quick summary: i purchased this iphone 14 pro max from the amazon renewed store. what i received was this yellow iphone xr as shown in the photo. a whole lot of suckiness; however, it assuredly gets worse.i reached out to amazon's customer service because i figured it was as simple as them saying, ""oh, whoops! we messed up! we'll send you a replacement and you can send us the wrong one back. here's a li'l credit for your trouble because we biffed it!"" sike!the first rep told me he couldn't replace it because it was a third party item - which was wrong, as i bought it from amazon directly as part of their renewed store. the rep told me to just buy another one, send the old one back, and then they'll refund me for the purchase of the flubbed-up phone. to be clear: i had to pay, up front, another $900 for a replacement phone and wait until i returned the old phone to get a refund. to make things even stankier, the iphone 14 pro max went up $84 since my purchase. when i mentioned that to the rep, he gave me one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯i escalated up the chain to a supervisor, who parroted the first guy's response. again, they want me to pay up front for a replacement phone plus an extra $84 for the new purchase price. the supervisor had a little more pull, so i negotiated for a credit for the price difference. this was after around an hour in their chat.here's another thing that amazon shrugged about: i have to be home to hand deliver the return to a ups driver. i can't drop it off somewhere, or print my own label and take it to ups, or put it in a ups drop-off container. as someone who works during the day, i'm not able to be home to do this. ""oh, they'll just leave a label at your door if you're not there,""  the supervisor says. to recap: i cannot print my own label, but a ups driver will come to my house and leave one for me if i'm not there to give him the package.to recap:- i purchased an iphone 14 max pro from amazon and received the wrong phone.- amazon would not send me a replacement, rather they asked me to re-purchase the phone at a higher price.- i had to negotiate with a supervisor in order to get a credit for the cost of the phone.- i cannot print the replacement label for the wrong phone and take it somewhere, but rather a ups driver has to come to my house and physically take the package from me. only then will i get a refund for the wrong phone.this was an exciting purchase turned sour. it was enough to give a normal person anxiety and to make an anxious person spiral out of control. buy at your own risk, or not at all.

 disclaimer: i ordered this phone twice. all complaints go to the first phone, which was sent back. the second phone was kept and is great. the video is of the first phone (which was sent back) and all the other photos are of the second phone. i rate these phones: 5 stars for the second phone, 3 stars for the first oneokay, so i received this phone and it was not packaged well at all. it came in an android box that was open and the phone had no secure place to sit (because it didn’t fit in that box) so it was sliding out/ halfway out the box when i opened the fedex bag. it came with a screen protector on it. when the screen protector cracked, i took it off and there were so many scratches on the screen. there were also a lot of scratches by the charging port, above the speakers, and on the edges of the phone. it came at 97% battery life and the function of the phone was totally fine. i wouldn’t say it was excellent condition at all, more like “good” or “okay” condition. i ended up sending this one back and reordering & received a brand new phone with no cosmetic defects and the phone at 100% battery life. phone was not eligible for apple care but is still under apples warranty.also, i’m very unsure why people are leaving bad reviews because this phone has an esim and not an actual sim card slot. apple moved over to esim starting with the iphone 14, so whenever you upgrade to the 14 or newer it is going to be an esim. it is literally the same thing as having a physical sim card. when setting up the phone it is literally the same except you don’t put in a sim card, it just makes you an esim when you transfer your number. it’s hassle free actually.

140,iPhone 13 Pro,554.4,128,"review for 13 pro “renewed premium “phone seems to be totally functional, is cosmetically in great condition, no visible damage. my only complaint is that the battery is not new. i received it with 91% maximum capacity battery health. you actually pay extra for that “premium” condition to receive one above 90%. . you are not told if the phone has any replacement parts or if it has been repaired. i think this should be transparent. i feel at ease because of the generous 1 year window to return or replace. i haven’t read the fine print but i believe outside of physical damage you caused to the phone, you can exchange or return it if any problems arise. i feel like the screen isn’t as responsive and precise to touch and that the speaker is very quiet. my boyfriend has commented to me that he cannot hear me as well when i am using speakerphone to call him since i got the new phone.as far as the model i don’t see a gigantic difference between one and the 11 model. the battery might last slightly longer and the camera has better zoom capabilities. i think that the max brightness of the screen is a little brighter. the price i paid is very comparable and competitive with the big sites that sell refurbished phones. definitely cheaper than apple of course but when you buy their refurbished phones you get a new battery and guarantee it has all apple parts.

145,iPhone SE,199.99,64,"overall, i had a good experience and i would give 4.5 stars. the only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. i emailed tetchytech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! excellent customer service.just like the product description said, it came with a sim card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. the charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, anker brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. also, the cable seemed brand new! i’m excited about that because it should last a long time. the block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. the charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. i tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. but like i said earlier, i emailed tetchytech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. i was happy about that. if i didn’t already have a backup charger, i would be pretty upset with tetchytech for giving me a broken charging block. so just be aware of that.the iphone itself: like new. very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. excellent job on the outside of the phone.everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when i tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. then, it started working again. it hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so i’m not too worried about it.the phone came 95% charged.

153,iPhone 13 Pro Max,608.0,128,"first time i ever bought a refurbished iphone and it was excellent. easy to buy, 2/3 the price, and high quality. i did not buy the premium renewal (no scratches and battery 90%+ health) but the standard which amazon said wound be scratches you can’t see from arm’s length and battery health 80%+. the condition was near perfect. no noticeable scrapes at any distance. looked good as new. battery health 83%. the config was easy. i had my existing phone next to it and used the apple method to copy everything phone to phone. took 30 minutes but everything copied over including photos, messages, apps, settings, logins, safari bookmarks, wallpaper, passwords, wifi ssids/passwords, and even contact photos. only logins i had to re-do were tfa and authenticator, which is to be expected. i am using this new phone on my sailboat for wifi only. instead of spending $6000 for data displays on my mast i bought the iphone 13 pro max for $450 plus a $50 bracket. it’s an unlocked iphone (no carrier or sim card) and by simply skipping the option to insert a sim or use an esim, it configured and put me on wifi automatically. all my apps and subscriptions work fine on the new phone plus old. subscriptions are appleid or user-login based not device based so you can reuse all your premium apps. appstore also worked as well as getting imessage on both phones now even without the cell services (since it’s data). so, very cost effective solution! i looked into doing this with my carrier (verizon) but you had to activate a new line which i didn’t want to do. plus their selection of used phones was not as good as amazon and the new phones are much more expensive if you are not trading in. so this is a great amazon service!

 please read full review if you are nervous from reading negative reviews….phew! boy was i nervous after reading negative reviews. turns out i either got lucky or those people used the charger that came with the box😅🤣… anyway my point is this is an incredible phone. this phone came with 32 gigabytes of storage instead of the 16gigs mentioned in the description, fingerprint recognition, working camera, zero scratches or signs of use, perfect brightness and battery, i’ve charged the phone one time (not fully) and it’s lasted me 2 hours so far. charged it to 50% two hours ago and now it’s at 23%.i have been able to use every app i have downloaded on my iphone 12 pro max on this little phone. it’s a trooper for sure. the phone has not gotten hot once after using it nonstop 2 hours after package received. do not use the cord and charger box that came with this phone as it is not original apple which will ruin your battery life, use an apple cord that you can purchase at your local walmart or best buy.another thing, phone came fully unlocked as stated in description. i’ve also downloaded a free app called text now to make calls and it works great. i will say this is a great purchase and i mean it.

168,iPhone 14,552.01,128,"amazon iphone 14 reviewrather than going into all the nifty  upgraded details and features of the iphone 14, this will be more of a summary of some key features with emphasis on amazon’s  renewed /refurbished program for iphones.iphone 14 is a terrific phone with very good battery life especially compared to the previous iphone mini iterations which sports smaller batteries.  also, apple has removed the physical sim slot for iphone 14 for us customers.transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iphone to iphone 14 wasn’t difficult.  it was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iphones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  it would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the wifi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  initially, both the old and new iphone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iphone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  as a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  this was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the wifi/home network faux pas (disconnection).this is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through amazon’s renewed premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). the first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.this time for the iphone 14, we decided to go with amazon renewed premium and actually sold by amazon.  given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  see attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.amazon also have renewed conditions of excellent, good and acceptable.  depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  however, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.the price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  it’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with amazon renewed premium condition sold by amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  the second choice will be amazon renewed premium condition sold by third party.it has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  so far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.

171,iPhone 14 Pro,709.97,128,"i did a lot of research before i arrived at this decision to purchase my next iphone. i’m not the average person that keeps upgrading year after year. i waited a good amount of time before i decided on this decision. and i love amazon, and when they said that they have a “renewed premium” iphone for sale…they mean it. apple does not sell pro variant predecessor models (14 pro/pro max, 13 pro/pro max, etc) but only the newest which are the 15 plus, pro/pro max ) so i had to look online and i found amazon to have the best deal. i unboxed my iphone 14 pro and i couldn’t believe my eyes as to how flawless the phone was. it had zero and i mean zero scratches!!!the screen looked good, camera, battery, sound,  and the back finish had zero smudges or scratches. for the price, i am absolutely satisfied. i usually bide my time and wait years to pay for a brand new phone but apple is asking for essentially a price of a mortgage payment for a new phone…it’s unrealistic. buying refurbished not only saved me money but it’s better for the environment and amazon does guarantee a 1 year return which is very gracious and i appreciate that, especially when you’re spending almost $1000 on a phone. the packaging was great and came with a usb cable and wall plug. i’m writing this review because i implore others to try out this opportunity because it’s good for your wallet and the environment. this changed the landscape of my cell phone shopping experience because i no longer have to pay full price for an iphone from apple. apple does have a refurbished/clearance section on their website but the availability of their models/sizes/colors is scarce and the prices are still hiked up. i do believe amazon “renewed premium” is the key to ensuring that you will get a high quality phone in good condition.the one thing that i found to be dubious of the shopping experience was that within the packaging, there was a card inside of a paper sleeve that had a bunch of checkboxes for the “technician” to check off all of the functions of the phone that were tested/passed and some of the checkboxes were titled “touchbar” and “trackpad”…and they were indeed checked on the checklist. but why? this is not a laptop or macbook and there is no “trackpad” or “touchbar” which leads me to challenge the integrity for the “testing” or “refurbishment” procedures at amazon. are they just checking all of the boxes to make it look presentably reliable or are they actually testing the functions of the phone? that’s something to consider. i did, however, test it myself and came to conclude that the phone was all good. would i trust this process and buy another phone from amazon, absolutely ! i just wanted to point that out.

299,iPhone 11,599.0,64,"i'm switching back to apple after 10 solid years of loyalty to android/google. the last iphone i owned was the 3g in 2010, and i'm switching over from the pixel 3. i used an iphone 8 plus while waiting for the 11 to get here so i can kind of compare it to that phone for the purpose of the review!i left google because the pixel was just totally failing me. constantly overheating, like constant, i no joke was sticking my phone in the refrigerator all day. i'm a heavy camera and spotify user, and the overheating of the pixel made a) the battery drain so bad that i could barely use it between charging, b) charge incredibly slow, and c) just run slow in general to the point that it felt like i really just could never use my phone.then one day my pixel just decided to stop charging and it's barely a year old. i was fed up. i asked all my family members if their iphones ever had overheating problems and everyone said no, so i decided i need a new phone anyway, i'll give apple a chance.here are my pro and cons of the 11 64gb:pros:- does not overheat at all so far. i've used it exactly the same as i used my pixel, taking and editing pictures and videos all day and playing spotify, and the few times it has gotten a little warm, it cooled off fast. so far overheating is not an issue, which is fantastic.- runs really smoothly. compared to the 8 plus both running ios 14, the ui and navigation feel far more smooth, everything feels pretty organic. it's a noticeable difference if you switch from an iphone that's 3+ years old. android is a smooth experience as well so i wouldn't say it's better, but i can tell apps are primarily designed with ios in mind and so the experience feels a little more advanced.- camera so far seems great. compared to the 8 plus it's lightyears better. clearer, better colors, faster. compared to the pixel 3, quality doesn't seem much different, but i like the color profile better, it's warmer in a nice way. and it doesn't overheat, so you can actually use it.- battery life is amazing so far. doesn't seem like it's draining at all with pretty heavy useage, or at least useage that would kill my pixel in about 10 minutes. better than the 8 plus also.- price is pretty good right now.- comes in some really nice colors. the purple is seriously cute.- much easier to integrate if you're a non-apple user than it was 10 years ago lol- face lock seems fine. i don't miss the fingerprint reader as much as i thought i would. i do kind of miss the reader on the back of the pixel but it's not a deal breaker.- i like imessage, it's actually a really nice experience and feels more involved than regular texting. google has some version of it but none of my friends or family has an android so it's pointless lol- cons:- i do have one issue with the ui and i noticed it in the 8 plus as well, but have never noticed it on a google phone. that is the touch screen in the corners seems to misfire or just not react at all. i'm still figuring out how to use back arrows the correct way because my phone just doesn't register what i think is me tapping things in the corners. it's a little frustrating. i'm not sure what the deal is.- the physical design is bulky. bulkier than the pixel 3. it doesn't bother me per se and i assume the body stays cooler because of it, but it makes it feel a little... old i guess. it also has a pretty thick border around the screen that makes it look a little older as well. but if it means the phone runs better, i'll take it.- the gmail app shows the number of outstanding emails i have and honestly it bothers me lol. google phones don't do this and i wish i could turn it off somehow... (can i?). i don't want to be reminded that i'm terrible at cleaning my inbox and have thousands of unread junk emails haunting me.- it bugs me that you have to pay monthly for icloud storage. you get 15gb free with google photos but only 5gb with icloud, and if you want more you have to pay monthly. i'd rather just pay a lump sum up front for extra storage.- doesn't come with the wall plug for charging, just the cord... what the?!

339,iPhone 12 Pro,840.13,128,"wife and i recently ""upgraded"" from our xr's to the 12 pros, mainly for the better cameras, 5g, and better screens. we didn't really need to as our xr's were running fine, and quite reliable, but we fell into the hype. dropped a bunch of money to get these phones and have overall had a bad experience. yeah, the camera is pretty great. i do like the wide angle lens, and night photos look better. the screen is slightly better, but really not by much. we did side to side next to our xrs and we could really only tell a difference on super hd videos. the metal casing of the pro's looks pretty slick. and that's all the good i have to say about them.first off, the battery seems worse than my xr. i never recall charging my xr throughout the day, but i find by the evening i'm worrying about my pro's battery and hunting for a charger. really frustrating. and that's with 5g turned off. which, by the way, doesn't seem to make a noticeable difference unless you're in a 5g hot area. i haven't noticed any difference in speed with it on or off.and as for durability, my wife was waiting for her phone case to arrive in the mail and so was carrying it around without a case for a few days (we figured the ads saying it was super durable glass meant that it could handle itself) but she dropped it one time as she was getting out of the car, and after falling 2-3 feet, the back of the entire phone shattered. so much for durability.and finally, if it couldn't be more annoying, it seems to have weird little glitches that our old phones never had. the bluetooth sometimes cuts out from my airpods, sound notifications change in volume suddenly and randomly, and worst of all, whenever i have it mounted in my car for gps, if it sits in the sun for more than 10 minutes the screen just goes super dark. like it's still at 100% brightness but it looks like it's at 40%. makes it impossible to see when driving and it doesn't fix itself for like an hour. haven't figured out a solution to that, but it's very frustrating when you need it to work.overall, yeah, it's an apple iphone. it's still a good device with a great camera, etc. but compared to cheaper and older models, it's a ripoff in my experience, especially for how expensive it is, and how it calls itself ""pro"". if i could return it and get my old phone i would. i'd highly recommend getting the cheaper 12, or just sticking with the 11 or xr if you have them. i'd wait until they improve this disappointing model.

380,iPhone 13 Pro Max,709.99,1000,"i recently purchased the iphone 13 pro max 1tb in graphite, and let me tell you, it's been an absolute game-changer. not only did i manage to snag it for an incredible price of $893 after tax, compared to its original $1600 price tag, but it has exceeded all my expectations.first off, let's talk about the display – it's a solid 10 out of 10. the vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and smooth responsiveness make every interaction a joy. the edges and sides score slightly lower at 8 out of 10, but they still feel premium and comfortable in hand. the back, however, is a perfect 10 – sleek, elegant, and practically smudge-proof.one of the best features of this phone is its massive storage capacity. coming from an iphone 11 with 128gb, upgrading to 1tb felt like going from a bicycle to a ferrari. i no longer have to worry about deleting photos, videos, or apps to make space – i can keep everything i need right on my phone.in terms of functionality, the phone is flawless. no dead pixels, fast charging with magsafe, and every feature working seamlessly. sure, it didn't come in the original box, but that's a minor detail compared to the savings i got.overall, i'd rate the condition of the phone at a solid 9.5 out of 10, considering both functionality and appearance. it's a sleek, powerful device that has completely transformed my mobile experience. if you're in the market for a top-of-the-line smartphone without breaking the bank, look no further than the iphone 13 pro max 1tb – you won't be disappointed!

458,iPhone 15 Pro Max,992.19,256,"my wife have been contemplating getting a new iphone because hers had reached the capacity on storage and the battery was not keeping a long charge. i think she had the iphone 8. we are not a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. so when i was searching for a phone i was looking at the iphone 11 or 12. but knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise i called our local apple store for advice. the gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. but he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology and she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. so i took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iphone 15. i'm genx. i came up when the nokia, sony erickson, motorola razr (the grey flat one) and nextel we're wassup. so spending a g on a phone was a hard no for me. but this time i said eff it. this phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. we're on verizon but the phone came unlocked. it took a little long because the phone needed an apple update but after an hour it was up and running. so if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iphone 15 pro max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. our experience was great 💯.

488,iPhone 15 Pro Max,1429.96,256,"i love my iphone. i've had great experiences with multiple iphones. i have almost nothing bad to say about iphones.so, why the 1-star review? iphone theft & loss insurance, which is offered with virtually every iphone purchase. just don't do it. it's a waste of money. don't take my word for it, search google for iphone theft & loss scam.here's the deal: apple farmed out this plan to the aig insurance company. they are not a good insurance company (once again, don't take my word for it, search aig is a terrible company and you'll get endless stories about the terrible workplace culture, how they helped trigger the great recession, and how they lie/cheat/steal on things like iphone theft & loss).while there are plenty of stories out there for your reading displeasure, i'll recount my daughter's - which is identical to thousands of others. she had her phone stolen while out at a bar. she realized within moments that it was gone, so she used another device for find my phone and saw that it was already on moving away from her location. she immediately contacted apple and they told her to follow their recommended steps in case of theft, which includes locking the phone. by the time she finished this, the phone had disappeared (the thief likely turned it off).the next day she filed a claim under theft & loss. it was denied because aig requires that find my phone be on for the ""entirety of the claims process."" so, her insurance was ""voided"" by the thief doing what they usually do - turning off the phone so that the actual owner can't find it. same will almost certainly happen if you drop it in a lake or have it run out of juice after being misplaced.buying theft & loss coverage from apple is literally just giving aig money for something they most likely won't honor. sure, it's only a few bucks a month, but if you're going to throw money away, do it on something less frustrating.

549,iPhone 15 Pro Max,1199.0,1000,"my wife have been contemplating getting a new iphone because hers had reached the capacity on storage and the battery was not keeping a long charge. i think she had the iphone 8. we are not a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. so when i was searching for a phone i was looking at the iphone 11 or 12. but knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise i called our local apple store for advice. the gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. but he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology and she wouldn't have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. so i took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this ""refurbished"" iphone 15. i'm genx. i came up when the nokia, sony erickson, motorola razr (the grey flat one) and nextel we're wassup. so spending a g on a phone was a hard no for me. but this time i said eff it. this phone was brand new, works flawlessly, it's everything she ever wanted from her old phone. we're on verizon but the phone came unlocked. it took a little long because the phone needed an apple update but after an hour it was up and running. so if you're on the fence about getting this ""refurbished"" iphone 15 pro max because of condition, functionality or network issues don't be. our experience was great 💯.
